v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of the publication of
the <i>Journal to Stella</i> is somewhat curious.&nbsp; On
Swift&rsquo;s death twenty-five of the letters, forming the
closing portion of the series, fell into the hands of Dr. Lyon, a
clergyman who had been in charge of Swift for some years.&nbsp;
The letters passed to a man named Wilkes, who sold them for
publication.&nbsp; They accordingly appeared in 1766 in the tenth
volume of Dr. Hawkesworth&rsquo;s quarto edition of Swift&rsquo;s
works; but the editor made many changes in the text, including a
suppression of most of the &ldquo;little language.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The publishers, however, fortunately for us, were public-spirited
enough to give the manuscripts (with one exception) to the
British Museum, where, after many years, they were examined by
John Forster, who printed in his unfinished <i>Life of Swift</i>
numerous passages from the originals, showing the manner in which
the text had been tampered with by Hawkesworth.&nbsp; Swift
himself, too, in his later years, obliterated many words and
sentences in the letters, and Forster was able to restore not a
few of these omissions.&nbsp; His zeal, however, sometimes led
him to make guesses at words which are quite
undecipherable.&nbsp; Besides Forster&rsquo;s work, I have had
the benefit of the careful collation made by Mr. Ryland for his
edition of 1897.&nbsp; Where these authorities differ I have
usually found myself in agreement with Mr. Ryland, but I have
felt justified in accepting some of Forster&rsquo;s readings
which <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>were
rejected by him as uncertain; and the examination of the
manuscripts has enabled me to make some additions and corrections
of my own.&nbsp; Swift&rsquo;s writing is extremely small, and
abounds in abbreviations.&nbsp; The difficulty of arriving at the
true reading is therefore considerable, apart from the
erasures.</p>
<p>The remainder of the <i>Journal</i>, consisting of the first
forty letters, was published in 1768 by Deane Swift, Dr.
Swift&rsquo;s second cousin.&nbsp; These letters had been given
to Mrs. Whiteway in 1788, and by her to her son-in-law, Deane
Swift.&nbsp; The originals have been lost, with the exception of
the first, which, by some accident, is in the British Museum; but
it is evident that Deane Swift took even greater liberties with
the text than Hawkesworth.&nbsp; He substituted for
&ldquo;Ppt&rdquo; the word &ldquo;Stella,&rdquo; a name which
Swift seems not to have used until some years later; he adopted
the name &ldquo;Presto&rdquo; for Swift, and in other ways tried
to give a greater literary finish to the letters.&nbsp; The whole
of the correspondence was first brought together, under the title
of the <i>Journal to Stella</i>, in Sheridan&rsquo;s edition of
1784.</p>
<p>Previous editions of the <i>Journal</i> have been but slightly
annotated.&nbsp; Swift&rsquo;s letters abound with allusions to
people of all classes with whom he came in contact in London, and
to others known to Esther Johnson in Ireland; and a large
proportion of these persons have been passed over in discreet
silence by Sir Walter Scott and others.&nbsp; The task of the
annotator has, of course, been made easier of late years by the
publication of contemporary journals and letters, and of useful
works of reference dealing with Parliament, the Army, the Church,
the Civil Service, and the like, besides the invaluable
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>.&nbsp; I have also been
assisted by a collection of MS. notes kindly placed at my
disposal by Mr. Thomas <a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>Seccombe.&nbsp; I have aimed at
brevity and relevance, but it is hoped that the reader will find
all the information that is necessary.&nbsp; Here and there a
name has baffled research, but I have been able to give definite
particulars of a very large number of people&mdash;noblemen and
ladies in society in London or Dublin, Members of Parliament,
doctors, clergymen, Government officials, and others who have
hitherto been but names to the reader of the
<i>Journal</i>.&nbsp; Where there is no reference at the foot of
the page, the note upon any person alluded to can readily be
found by consulting the Index.&nbsp; I have corrected a good many
errors in the older notes, but in dealing with so large a number
of persons, some of whom it is difficult to identify, I cannot
hope that I myself have escaped pitfalls.</p>

ix</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Swift began to write the
letters known as the <i>Journal to Stella</i>, he was forty-two
years of age, and Esther Johnson twenty-nine.&nbsp; Perhaps the
most useful introduction to the correspondence will be a brief
setting forth of what is known of their friendship from
Stella&rsquo;s childhood, the more specially as the question has
been obscured by many assertions and theories resting on a very
slender basis of fact.</p>
<p>Jonathan Swift, born in 1667 after his father&rsquo;s death,
was educated by his uncle Godwin, and after a not very successful
career at Trinity College, Dublin, went to stay with his mother,
Abigail Erick, at Leicester.&nbsp; Mrs. Swift feared that her son
would fall in love with a girl named Betty Jones, but, as Swift
told a friend, he had had experience enough &ldquo;not to think
of marriage till I settle my fortune in the world, which I am
sure will not be in some years; and even then, I am so hard to
please that I suppose I shall put it off to the other
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon afterwards an opening for Swift
presented itself.&nbsp; Sir William Temple, now living in
retirement at Moor Park, near Farnham, had been, like his father,
Master of the Irish Rolls, and had thus become acquainted with
Swift&rsquo;s uncle Godwin.&nbsp; Moreover, Lady Temple was
related to Mrs. Swift, as Lord Orrery tells us.&nbsp; Thanks to
these facts, the application to Sir William Temple was
successful, and Swift went to live at Moor Park before the end of
1689.&nbsp; There he <a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>read to Temple, wrote for him, and kept his accounts, and
growing into confidence with his employer, &ldquo;was often
trusted with matters of great importance.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
story&mdash;afterwards improved upon by Lord Macaulay&mdash;that
Swift received only &pound;20 and his board, and was not allowed
to sit at table with his master, is wholly untrustworthy.&nbsp;
Within three years of their first intercourse, Temple had
introduced his secretary to William the Third, and sent him to
London to urge the King to consent to a bill for triennial
Parliaments.</p>
<p>When Swift took up his residence at Moor Park he found there a
little girl of eight, daughter of a merchant named Edward
Johnson, who had died young.&nbsp; Swift says that Esther Johnson
was born on March 18, 1681; in the parish register of Richmond,
<a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a> which shows that she was baptized on
March 20, 1680&ndash;81, her name is given as Hester; but she
signed her will &ldquo;Esther,&rdquo; the name by which she was
always known.&nbsp; Swift says, &ldquo;Her father was a younger
brother of a good family in Nottinghamshire, her mother of a
lower degree; and indeed she had little to boast in her
birth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Johnson had two children, Esther and
Ann, and lived at Moor Park as companion to Lady Giffard,
Temple&rsquo;s widowed sister.&nbsp; Another member of the
household, afterwards to be Esther&rsquo;s constant companion,
was Rebecca Dingley, a relative of the Temple family. <a
name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b"
class="citation">[0b]</a>&nbsp; She was a year or two older than
Swift.</p>
<p>The lonely young man of twenty-two was both playfellow and
teacher of the delicate child of eight.&nbsp; How he taught her
to write has been charmingly brought before us in the painting
exhibited by Miss Dicksee at the Royal <a name="pagexi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xi</span>Academy a few years ago; he advised
her what books to read, and instructed her, as he says, &ldquo;in
the principles of honour and virtue, from which she never swerved
in any one action or moment of her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By 1694 Swift had grown tired of his position, and finding
that Temple, who valued his services, was slow in finding him
preferment, he left Moor Park in order to carry out his resolve
to go into the Church.&nbsp; He was ordained, and obtained the
prebend of Kilroot, near Belfast, where he carried on a
flirtation with a Miss Waring, whom he called Varina.&nbsp; But
in May 1696 Temple made proposals which induced Swift to return
to Moor Park, where he was employed in preparing Temple&rsquo;s
memoirs and correspondence for publication, and in supporting the
side taken by Temple in the Letters of Phalaris controversy by
writing <i>The Battle of the Books</i>, which was, however, not
published until 1704.&nbsp; On his return to Temple&rsquo;s
house, Swift found his old playmate grown from a sickly child
into a girl of fifteen, in perfect health.&nbsp; She came, he
says, to be &ldquo;looked upon as one of the most beautiful,
graceful, and agreeable young women in London, only a little too
fat.&nbsp; Her hair was blacker than a raven, and every feature
of her face in perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his death in January 1699, Temple left a will, <a
name="citation0c"></a><a href="#footnote0c"
class="citation">[0c]</a> dated 1694, directing the payment of
&pound;20 each, with half a year&rsquo;s wages, to Bridget
Johnson &ldquo;and all my other servants&rdquo;; and leaving a
lease of some land in Monistown, County Wicklow, to Esther
Johnson, &ldquo;servant to my sister Giffard.&rdquo;&nbsp; By a
codicil of February 1698, Temple left &pound;100 to &ldquo;Mr.
Jonathan Swift, now living with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be added
that by her will of 1722, proved in the following year, Lady
Giffard gave &pound;20 to Mrs. Moss&mdash;Mrs. Bridget Johnson,
who had married Richard Mose or <a name="pagexii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xii</span>Moss, Lady Giffard&rsquo;s
steward.&nbsp; The will proceeds: &ldquo;To Mrs. Hester
(<i>sic</i>) Johnson I give &pound;10, with the &pound;100 I put
into the Exchequer for her life and my own, and declare the
&pound;100 to be hers which I am told is there in my name upon
the survivorship, and for which she has constantly sent over her
certificate and received the interest.&nbsp; I give her besides
my two little silver candlesticks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Temple left in Swift&rsquo;s hands the task of publishing his
posthumous works, a duty which afterwards led to a quarrel with
Lady Giffard and other members of the family.&nbsp; Many years
later Swift told Lord Palmerston that he stopped at Moor Park
solely for the benefit of Temple&rsquo;s conversation and advice,
and the opportunity of pursuing his studies.&nbsp; At
Temple&rsquo;s death he was &ldquo;as far to seek as
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the summer of 1699, however, he was offered
and accepted the post of secretary and chaplain to the Earl of
Berkeley, one of the Lords Justices, but when he reached Ireland
he found that the secretaryship had been given to another.&nbsp;
He soon, however, obtained the living of Laracor, Agher, and
Rathbeggan, and the prebend of Dunlavin in St. Patrick&rsquo;s
Cathedral, Dublin.&nbsp; The total value of these preferments was
about &pound;230 a year, an income which Miss Waring seems to
have thought enough to justify him in marrying.&nbsp;
Swift&rsquo;s reply to the lady whom he had &ldquo;singled out at
first from the rest of women&rdquo; could only have been written
with the intention of breaking off the connection, and
accordingly we hear no more of poor Varina.</p>
<p>At Laracor, a mile or two from Trim, and twenty miles from
Dublin, Swift ministered to a congregation of about fifteen
persons, and had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden,
making a canal (after the Dutch fashion of Moor Park), planting
willows, and rebuilding the vicarage.&nbsp; <a
name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>As
chaplain to Lord Berkeley, he spent much of his time in
Dublin.&nbsp; He was on intimate terms with Lady Berkeley and her
daughters, one of whom is best known by her married name of Lady
Betty Germaine; and through them he had access to the fashionable
society of Dublin.&nbsp; When Lord Berkeley returned to England
in April 1701, Swift, after taking his Doctor&rsquo;s degree at
Dublin, went with him, and soon afterwards published,
anonymously, a political pamphlet, <i>A Discourse on the Contests
and Dissentions in Athens and Rome</i>.&nbsp; When he returned to
Ireland in September he was accompanied by Stella&mdash;to give
Esther Johnson the name by which she is best known&mdash;and her
friend Mrs. Dingley.&nbsp; Stella&rsquo;s fortune was about
&pound;1500, and the property Temple had left her was in County
Wicklow.&nbsp; Swift, very much for his &ldquo;own satisfaction,
who had few friends or acquaintance in Ireland,&rdquo; persuaded
Stella&mdash;now twenty years old&mdash;that living was cheaper
there than in England, and that a better return was obtainable on
money.&nbsp; The ladies took his advice, and made Ireland their
home.&nbsp; At first they felt themselves strangers in Dublin;
&ldquo;the adventure looked so like a frolic,&rdquo; Swift says,
&ldquo;the censure held for some time as if there were a secret
history in such a removal: which however soon blew off by her
excellent conduct.&rdquo;&nbsp; Swift took every step that was
possible to avoid scandal.&nbsp; When he was away, the ladies
occupied his rooms; when he returned, they went into their own
lodgings.&nbsp; When he was absent, they often stopped at the
vicarage at Laracor, but if he were there, they moved to Trim,
where they visited the vicar, Dr. Raymond, or lived in lodgings
in the town or neighbourhood.&nbsp; Swift was never with Stella
except in the presence of a third person, and in 1726 he said
that he had not seen her in a morning &ldquo;these dozen years,
except once or twice in a journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiv</span>During a visit to England in the winter of 1703&ndash;4
we find Swift in correspondence with the Rev. William Tisdall, a
Dublin incumbent whom he had formerly known at Belfast.&nbsp;
Tisdall was on friendly terms with Stella and Mrs. Dingley, and
Swift sent messages to them through him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray put
them upon reading,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and be always teaching
something to Mrs. Johnson, because she is good at comprehending,
remembering and retaining.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the correspondence
soon took a different turn.&nbsp; Tisdall paid his addresses to
Stella, and charged Swift with opposing his suit.&nbsp;
Tisdall&rsquo;s letters are missing, but Swift&rsquo;s reply of
April 20, 1704, puts things sufficiently clearly.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
conjecture is,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that you think I obstructed
your inclinations to please my own, and that my intentions were
the same with yours.&nbsp; In answer to all which I will, upon my
conscience and honour, tell you the naked truth.&nbsp; First, I
think I have said to you before that, if my fortunes and humour
served me to think of that state, I should certainly, among all
persons upon earth, make your choice; because I never saw that
person whose conversation I entirely valued but hers; this was
the utmost I ever gave way to.&nbsp; And secondly, I must assure
you sincerely that this regard of mine never once entered into my
head to be an impediment to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had thought
Tisdall not rich enough to marry; &ldquo;but the objection of
your fortune being removed, I declare I have no other; nor shall
any consideration of my own misfortune, in losing so good a
friend and companion as her, prevail on me, against her interest
and settlement in the world, since it is held so necessary and
convenient a thing for ladies to marry, and that time takes off
from the lustre of virgins in all other eyes but mine.&nbsp; I
appeal to my letters to herself whether I was your friend or not
in the whole concern, though the part I designed to act in it was
<a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>purely
passive.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had even thought &ldquo;it could not be
decently broken,&rdquo; without disadvantage to the lady&rsquo;s
credit, since he supposed it was known to the town; and he had
always spoken of her in a manner far from discouraging.&nbsp;
Though he knew many ladies of rank, he had &ldquo;nowhere met
with an humour, a wit, or conversation so agreeable, a better
portion of good sense, or a truer judgment of men or
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; He envied Tisdall his prudence and temper,
and love of peace and settlement, &ldquo;the reverse of which has
been the great uneasiness of my life, and is likely to continue
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This letter has been quoted at some length because of its
great importance.&nbsp; It is obviously capable of various
interpretations, and some, like Dr. Johnson, have concluded that
Swift was resolved to keep Stella in his power, and therefore
prevented an advantageous match by making unreasonable
demands.&nbsp; I cannot see any ground for this interpretation,
though it is probable that Tisdall&rsquo;s appearance as a suitor
was sufficiently annoying.&nbsp; There is no evidence that Stella
viewed Tisdall&rsquo;s proposal with any favour, unless it can be
held to be furnished by Swift&rsquo;s belief that the town
thought&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;that there was an
engagement.&nbsp; In any case, there could be no mistake in
future with regard to Swift&rsquo;s attitude towards
Stella.&nbsp; She was dearer to him than anyone else, and his
feeling for her would not change, but for marriage he had neither
fortune nor humour.&nbsp; Tisdall consoled himself by marrying
another lady two years afterwards; and though for a long time
Swift entertained for him feelings of dislike, in later life
their relations improved, and Tisdall was one of the witnesses to
Swift&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>The <i>Tale of a Tub</i> was published in 1704, and Swift was
soon in constant intercourse with Addison and the other
wits.&nbsp; While he was in England in 1705, Stella and <a
name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>Mrs.
Dingley made a short visit to London.&nbsp; This and a similar
visit in 1708 are the only occasions on which Stella is known to
have left Ireland after taking up her residence in that
country.&nbsp; Swift&rsquo;s influence over women was always very
striking.&nbsp; Most of the toasts of the day were his friends,
and he insisted that any lady of wit and quality who desired his
acquaintance should make the first advances.&nbsp; This, he
says&mdash;writing in 1730&mdash;had been an established rule for
over twenty years.&nbsp; In 1708 a dispute on this question with
one toast, Mrs. Long, was referred for settlement to Ginckel
Vanhomrigh, the son of the house where it was proposed that the
meeting should take place; and by the decision&mdash;which was in
Swift&rsquo;s favour&mdash;&ldquo;Mrs. Vanhomrigh and her fair
daughter Hessy&rdquo; were forbidden to aid Mrs. Long in her
disobedience for the future.&nbsp; This is the first that we hear
of Hester or Esther Vanhomrigh, who was afterwards to play so
marked a part in the story of Swift&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Born on
February 14, 1690, she was now eighteen.&nbsp; Her father,
Bartholomew Vanhomrigh, a Dublin merchant of Dutch origin, had
died in 1703, leaving his wife a fortune of some sixteen thousand
pounds.&nbsp; On the income from this money Mrs. Vanhomrigh, with
her two daughters, Hester and Mary, were able to mix in
fashionable society in London.&nbsp; Swift was introduced to them
by Sir Andrew Fountaine early in 1708, but evidently Stella did
not make their acquaintance, nor indeed hear much, if anything,
of them until the time of the <i>Journal</i>.</p>
<p>Swift&rsquo;s visit to London in 1707&ndash;9 had for its
object the obtaining for the Irish Church of the surrender by the
Crown of the First-Fruits and Twentieths, which brought in about
&pound;2500 a year.&nbsp; Nothing came of Swift&rsquo;s
interviews with the Whig statesmen, and after many
disappointments he returned to Laracor (June 1709), and conversed
with <a name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvii</span>none but Stella and her card-playing friends, and
Addison, now secretary to Lord Wharton. <a
name="citation0d"></a><a href="#footnote0d"
class="citation">[0d]</a>&nbsp; Next year came the fall of the
Whigs, and a request to Swift from the Irish bishops that he
would renew the application for the First-Fruits, in the hope
that there would be greater success with the Tories.&nbsp; Swift
reached London in September 1710, and began the series of
letters, giving details of the events of each day, which now form
the <i>Journal to Stella</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will write something
every day to MD,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and make it a sort of
journal; and when it is full I will send it, whether MD writes or
no; and so that will be pretty; and I shall always be in
conversation with MD, and MD with Presto.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
interesting to note that by way of caution these letters were
usually addressed to Mrs. Dingley, and not to Stella.</p>
<p>The story of Swift&rsquo;s growing intimacy with the Tory
leaders, of the success of his mission, of the increasing
coolness towards older acquaintances, and of his services to the
Government, can best be read in the <i>Journal</i> itself.&nbsp;
In the meantime the intimacy with the Vanhomrighs grew
rapidly.&nbsp; They were near neighbours of Swift&rsquo;s, and in
a few weeks after his arrival in town we find frequent allusions
to the dinners at their house (where he kept his best gown and
periwig), sometimes with the explanation that he went there
&ldquo;out of mere listlessness,&rdquo; or because it was wet, or
because another engagement had broken down.&nbsp; Only thrice
does he mention the &ldquo;eldest daughter&rdquo;: once on her
birthday; once on the occasion of a trick played him, when he
received a message that she was suddenly very ill (&ldquo;I
rattled off the daughter&rdquo;); and once to state that she was
come of age, and was going to Ireland to look after her
fortune.&nbsp; There is evidence <a name="pagexviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>that &ldquo;Miss Essy,&rdquo; or
Vanessa, to give her the name by which she will always be known,
was in correspondence with Swift in July 1710&mdash;while he was
still in Ireland&mdash;and in the spring of 1711; <a
name="citation0e"></a><a href="#footnote0e"
class="citation">[0e]</a> and early in 1711 Stella seems to have
expressed surprise at Swift&rsquo;s intimacy with the family, for
in February he replied, &ldquo;You say they are of no
consequence; why, they keep as good female company as I do male;
I see all the drabs of quality at this end of the town with
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the autumn Swift seems to have thought that
Vanessa was keeping company with a certain Hatton, but Mrs.
Long&mdash;possibly meaning to give him a warning
hint&mdash;remarked that if this were so &ldquo;she is not the
girl I took her for; but to me she seems melancholy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1712 occasional letters took the place of the daily journal
to &ldquo;MD,&rdquo; but there is no change in the affectionate
style in which Swift wrote.&nbsp; In the spring he had a long
illness, which affected him, indeed, throughout the year.&nbsp;
Other reasons which he gives for the falling off in his
correspondence are his numerous business engagements, and the
hope of being able to send some good news of an appointment for
himself.&nbsp; There is only one letter to Stella between July 19
and September 15, and Dr. Birkbeck Hill argues that the poem
&ldquo;Cadenus and Vanessa&rdquo; was composed at that time. <a
name="citation0f"></a><a href="#footnote0f"
class="citation">[0f]</a>&nbsp; If this be so, it must have been
altered next year, because it was not until 1713 that Swift was
made a Dean.&nbsp; Writing on April 19, 1726, Swift said that the
poem &ldquo;was written at Windsor near fourteen years ago, and
dated: it was a task performed on a frolic among some ladies, and
she it was addressed to died some time ago in Dublin, and on her
death the copy shewn by her executor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several copies
were in circulation, <a name="pagexix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xix</span>and he was indifferent what was done
with it; it was &ldquo;only a cavalier business,&rdquo; and if
those who would not give allowances were malicious, it was only
what he had long expected.</p>
<p>From this letter it would appear that this remarkable poem was
written in the summer of 1712; whereas the title-page of the
pamphlet says it was &ldquo;written at Windsor,
1713.&rdquo;&nbsp; Swift visited Windsor in both years, but he
had more leisure in 1712, and we know that Vanessa was also at
Windsor in that year.&nbsp; In that year, too, he was forty-four,
the age mentioned in the poem.&nbsp; Neither Swift nor Vanessa
forgot this intercourse: years afterwards Swift wrote to her,
&ldquo;Go over the scenes of Windsor. . . .&nbsp; Cad thinks
often of these&rdquo;; and again, &ldquo;Remember the
indisposition at Windsor.&rdquo;&nbsp; We know that this poem was
revised in 1719, when in all probability Swift added the lines to
which most exception can be taken.&nbsp; Cadenus was to be
Vanessa&rsquo;s instructor:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His conduct might have made him styled<br
/>
A father, and the nymph his child.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had &ldquo;grown old in politics and wit,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;in every scene had kept his heart,&rdquo; so that he now
&ldquo;understood not what was love.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he had
written much, and Vanessa admired his wit.&nbsp; Cadenus found
that her thoughts wandered&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Though she seemed to listen more<br />
To all he spoke than e&rsquo;er before.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When she confessed her love, he was filled with &ldquo;shame,
disappointment, guilt, surprise.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had aimed only
at cultivating the mind, and had hardly known whether she was
young or old.&nbsp; But he was flattered, and though he could not
give her love, he offered her friendship, &ldquo;with <a
name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xx</span>gratitude,
respect, esteem.&rdquo;&nbsp; Vanessa took him at his word, and
said she would now be tutor, though he was not apt to
learn:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But what success Vanessa met<br />
Is to the world a secret yet.<br />
Whether the nymph to please her swain<br />
Talks in a high romantic strain;<br />
Or whether he at last descends<br />
To act with less seraphic ends;<br />
Or, to compound the business, whether<br />
They temper love and books together,<br />
Must never to mankind be told,<br />
Nor shall the conscious Muse unfold.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the poem as we now have it, written, it must be
remembered, for Vanessa&rsquo;s private perusal.&nbsp; It is to
be regretted, for her own sake, that she did not destroy it.</p>
<p>Swift received the reward of his services to the
Government&mdash;the Deanery of St. Patrick&rsquo;s,
Dublin&mdash;in April 1713.&nbsp; Disappointed at what he
regarded as exile, he left London in June.&nbsp; Vanessa
immediately began to send him letters which brought home to him
the extent of her passion; and she hinted at jealousy in the
words, &ldquo;If you are very happy, it is ill-natured of you not
to tell me so, except &rsquo;tis what is inconsistent with my
own.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his reply Swift dwelt upon the dreariness of
his surroundings at Laracor, and reminded her that he had said he
would endeavour to forget everything in England, and would write
as seldom as he could.</p>
<p>Swift was back again in the political strife in London in
September, taking Oxford&rsquo;s part in the quarrel between that
statesman and Bolingbroke.&nbsp; On the fall of the Tories at the
death of Queen Anne, he saw that all was over, and retired to
Ireland, not to return again for twelve years.&nbsp; In the
meantime the intimacy with Vanessa had been renewed.&nbsp; Her
mother had died, leaving debts, and she <a
name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>pressed
Swift for advice in the management of her affairs.&nbsp; When she
suggested coming to Ireland, where she had property, he told her
that if she took this step he would &ldquo;see her very
seldom.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, she took up her abode at Celbridge,
only a few miles from Dublin.&nbsp; Swift gave her many cautions,
out of &ldquo;the perfect esteem and friendship&rdquo; he felt
for her, but he often visited her.&nbsp; She was dissatisfied,
however, begging him to speak kindly, and at least to counterfeit
his former indulgent friendship.&nbsp; &ldquo;What can be
wrong,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;in seeing and advising an unhappy
young woman?&nbsp; You cannot but know that your frowns make my
life unsupportable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes he treated the matter
lightly; sometimes he showed annoyance; sometimes he assured her
of his esteem and love, but urged her not to make herself or him
&ldquo;unhappy by imaginations.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was uniformly
unsuccessful in stopping Vanessa&rsquo;s importunity.&nbsp; He
endeavoured, she said, by severities to force her from him; she
knew she was the cause of uneasy reflections to him; but nothing
would lessen her &ldquo;inexpressible passion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately he failed&mdash;partly no doubt from mistaken
considerations of kindness, partly because he shrank from losing
her affection&mdash;to take effective steps to put an end to
Vanessa&rsquo;s hopes.&nbsp; It would have been better if he had
unhesitatingly made it clear to her that he could not return her
passion, and that if she could not be satisfied with friendship
the intimacy must cease.&nbsp; To quote Sir Henry Craik,
&ldquo;The friendship had begun in literary guidance: it was
strengthened by flattery: it lived on a cold and almost stern
repression, fed by confidences as to literary schemes, and by
occasional literary compliments: but it never came to have a real
hold over Swift&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With 1716 we come to the alleged marriage with Stella.&nbsp;
In 1752, seven years after Swift&rsquo;s death, Lord Orrery, in
<a name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxii</span>his
<i>Remarks</i> on Swift, said that Stella was &ldquo;the
concealed, but undoubted, wife of Dr. Swift. . . .&nbsp; If my
informations are right, she was married to Dr. Swift in the year
1716, by Dr. Ashe, then Bishop of Clogher.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ten years
earlier, in 1742, in a letter to Deane Swift which I have not
seen quoted before, Orrery spoke of the advantage of a wife to a
man in his declining years; &ldquo;nor had the Dean felt a blow,
or wanted a companion, had he been married, or, in other words,
had Stella lived.&rdquo;&nbsp; What this means is not at all
clear.&nbsp; In 1754, Dr. Delany, an old friend of Swift&rsquo;s,
wrote, in comment upon Orrery&rsquo;s <i>Remarks</i>, &ldquo;Your
account of his marriage is, I am satisfied, true.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
1789, George Monck Berkeley, in his <i>Literary Relics</i>, said
that Swift and Stella were married by Dr. Ashe, &ldquo;who
himself related the circumstances to Bishop Berkeley, by whose
relict the story was communicated to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Ashe
cannot have told Bishop Berkeley by word of mouth, because Ashe
died in 1717, the year after the supposed marriage, and Berkeley
was then still abroad.&nbsp; But Berkeley was at the time tutor
to Ashe&rsquo;s son, and may therefore have been informed by
letter, though it is difficult to believe that Ashe would write
about such a secret so soon after the event.&nbsp; Thomas
Sheridan, on information received from his father, Dr. Sheridan,
Swift&rsquo;s friend, accepted the story of the marriage in his
book (1784), adding particulars which are of very doubtful
authenticity; and Johnson, in his <i>Lives of the Poets</i>, says
that Dr. Madden told him that Stella had related her
&ldquo;melancholy story&rdquo; to Dr. Sheridan before her
death.&nbsp; On the other hand, Dr. Lyon, Swift&rsquo;s attendant
in his later years, disbelieved the story of the marriage, which
was, he said, &ldquo;founded only on hearsay&rdquo;; and Mrs.
Dingley &ldquo;laughed at it as an idle tale,&rdquo; founded on
suspicion.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Craik is satisfied with the evidence for the
marriage.&nbsp; Mr. Leslie Stephen is of opinion that it is in<a
name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiii</span>conclusive, and Forster could find no evidence that
is at all reasonably sufficient; while Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole,
Mr. Churton Collins, and others are strongly of opinion that no
such marriage ever took place.&nbsp; A full discussion of the
evidence would involve the consideration of the reliability of
the witnesses, and the probability of their having authentic
information, and would be out of place here.&nbsp; My own opinion
is that the evidence for the marriage is very far from
convincing, and this view seems to be confirmed by all that we
know from his own letters of Swift&rsquo;s relations with
Stella.&nbsp; It has been suggested that she was pained by
reports of Swift&rsquo;s intercourse with Vanessa, and felt that
his feelings towards herself were growing colder; but this is
surmise, and no satisfactory explanation has been given to
account for a form of marriage being gone through after so many
years of the closest friendship.&nbsp; There is no reason to
suppose that there was at the time any gossip in circulation
about Stella, and if her reputation was in question, a marriage
of which the secret was carefully kept would obviously be of no
benefit to her.&nbsp; Moreover, we are told that there was no
change in their mode of life; if they were married, what reason
could there be for keeping it a secret, or for denying themselves
the closer relationship of marriage?&nbsp; The only possible
benefit to Stella was that Swift would be prevented marrying
anyone else.&nbsp; It is impossible, of course, to disprove a
marriage which we are told was secretly performed, without banns
or licence or witnesses; but we may reasonably require strong
evidence for so startling a step.&nbsp; If we reject the tale,
the story of Swift&rsquo;s connection with Stella is at least
intelligible; while the acceptance of this marriage introduces
many puzzling circumstances, and makes it necessary to believe
that during the remainder of Stella&rsquo;s life Swift repeatedly
spoke of his wife as a friend, and of himself as one who had
never <a name="pagexxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiv</span>married. <a name="citation0g"></a><a
href="#footnote0g" class="citation">[0g]</a>&nbsp; What right
have we to put aside Swift&rsquo;s plain and repeated
statements?&nbsp; Moreover, his attitude towards Vanessa for the
remaining years of her life becomes much more culpable if we are
to believe that he had given Stella the claim of a wife upon him.
<a name="citation0h"></a><a href="#footnote0h"
class="citation">[0h]</a></p>
<p>From 1719 onwards we have a series of poems to Stella, written
chiefly in celebration of her birthday.&nbsp; She was now
thirty-eight (Swift says, &ldquo;Thirty-four&mdash;we
shan&rsquo;t dispute a year or more&rdquo;), and the verses
abound in laughing allusions to her advancing years and wasting
form.&nbsp; Hers was &ldquo;an angel&rsquo;s face a little
cracked,&rdquo; but all men would crowd to her door when she was
fourscore.&nbsp; His verses to her had always been</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Without one word of Cupid&rsquo;s darts,<br
/>
Of killing eyes, or bleeding hearts;<br />
With friendship and esteem possessed,<br />
I ne&rsquo;er admitted Love a guest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her only fault was that she could not bear the lightest touch
of blame.&nbsp; Her wit and sense, her loving care in
illness&mdash;to which he owed that fact that he was alive to say
it&mdash;made her the &ldquo;best pattern of true
friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; She replied, in lines written on
Swift&rsquo;s birthday in 1721, that she was his pupil and humble
friend.&nbsp; He had trained her judgment and refined her fancy
and taste:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You taught how I might youth prolong<br />
By knowing what was right and wrong;<br />
How from my heart to bring supplies<br />
Of lustre to my fading eyes;<br />
<a name="pagexxv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxv</span>How soon
a beauteous mind repairs<br />
The loss of changed or falling hairs;<br />
How wit and virtue from within<br />
Send out a smoothness o&rsquo;er the skin<br />
Your lectures could my fancy fix,<br />
And I can please at thirty-six.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1723 Vanessa is said to have written to Stella or to
Swift&mdash;there are discrepancies in the versions given by
Sheridan and Lord Orrery, both of whom are
unreliable&mdash;asking whether the report that they were married
was true.&nbsp; Swift, we are told, rode to Celbridge, threw down
Vanessa&rsquo;s letter in a great rage, and left without speaking
a word. <a name="citation0i"></a><a href="#footnote0i"
class="citation">[0i]</a>&nbsp; Vanessa, whose health had been
failing for some time, died shortly afterwards, having cancelled
a will in Swift&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; She left &ldquo;Cadenus and
Vanessa&rdquo; for publication, and when someone said that she
must have been a remarkable woman to inspire such a poem, Stella
replied that it was well known that the Dean could write finely
upon a broomstick.</p>
<p>Soon after this tragedy Swift became engrossed in the Irish
agitation which led to the publication of the <i>Drapier&rsquo;s
Letters</i>, and in 1726 he paid a long-deferred visit to London,
taking with him the manuscript of <i>Gulliver&rsquo;s
Travels</i>.&nbsp; While in England he was harassed by bad news
of Stella, who had been in continued ill-health for some
years.&nbsp; His letters to friends in Dublin show how greatly he
suffered.&nbsp; To the Rev. John Worrall he wrote, in a letter
which he begged him to burn, &ldquo;What you tell <a
name="pagexxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxvi</span>me of
Mrs. Johnson I have long expected with great oppression and
heaviness of heart.&nbsp; We have been perfect friends these
thirty-five years.&nbsp; Upon my advice they both came to
Ireland, and have been ever since my constant companions; and the
remainder of my life will be a very melancholy scene, when one of
them is gone, whom I most esteemed, upon the score of every good
quality that can possibly recommend a human
creature.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would not for the world be present at
her death: &ldquo;I should be a trouble to her, and a torment to
myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Stella came to Dublin, he begged that she
might be lodged in some airy, healthy part, and not in the
Deanery, where too it would be improper for her to die.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is not a greater folly,&rdquo; he thinks,
&ldquo;than to contract too great and intimate a friendship,
which must always leave the survivor miserable.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
Dr. Stopford he wrote in similar terms of the &ldquo;younger of
the two&rdquo; &ldquo;oldest and dearest friends I have in the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This was a person of my own rearing
and instructing from childhood, who excelled in every good
quality that can possibly accomplish a human creature. . .
.&nbsp; I know not what I am saying; but believe me that violent
friendship is much more lasting and as much engaging as violent
love.&rdquo;&nbsp; To Dr. Sheridan he said, &ldquo;I look upon
this to be the greatest event that can ever happen to me; but all
my preparation will not suffice to make me bear it like a
philosopher nor altogether like a Christian.&nbsp; There hath
been the most intimate friendship between us from our childhood,
and the greatest merit on her side that ever was in one human
creature towards another.&rdquo; <a name="citation0j"></a><a
href="#footnote0j" class="citation">[0j]</a>&nbsp; Pope alludes
in a letter to Sheridan to the illness of Swift&rsquo;s
&ldquo;particular friend,&rdquo; but with the <a
name="pagexxvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxvii</span>exception of another reference by Pope, and of a
curiously flippant remark by Bolingbroke, the subject is nowhere
mentioned in Swift&rsquo;s correspondence with his literary and
fashionable friends in London.</p>
<p>Swift crossed to Ireland in August, fearing the worst; but
Stella rallied, and in the spring of 1727 he returned to
London.&nbsp; In August, however, there came alarming news, when
Swift was himself suffering from giddiness and deafness.&nbsp; To
Dr. Sheridan he wrote that the last act of life was always a
tragedy at best: &ldquo;it is a bitter aggravation to have
one&rsquo;s best friend go before one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Life was
indifferent to him; if he recovered from his disorder it would
only be to feel the loss of &ldquo;that person for whose sake
only life was worth preserving.&nbsp; I brought both those
friends over that we might be happy together as long as God
should please; the knot is broken, and the remaining person you
know has ill answered the end; and the other, who is now to be
lost, is all that was valuable.&rdquo;&nbsp; To Worrall he again
wrote (in Latin) that Stella ought not to be lodged at the
Deanery; he had enemies who would place a bad interpretation upon
it if she died there.</p>
<p>Swift left London for Dublin in September; he was detained
some days at Holyhead by stress of weather, and in the private
journal which he kept during that time he speaks of the suspense
he was in about his &ldquo;dearest friend.&rdquo; <a
name="citation0k"></a><a href="#footnote0k"
class="citation">[0k]</a>&nbsp; In December Stella made a
will&mdash;signed &ldquo;Esther Johnson,
spinster&rdquo;&mdash;disposing of her property in the manner
Swift had suggested.&nbsp; Her allusions to Swift are
incompatible with any such feeling of resentment as is suggested
by Sheridan.&nbsp; She died on January 28, 1728.&nbsp; Swift
could <a name="pagexxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxviii</span>not bear to be present, but on the night of her
death he began to write his very interesting <i>Character of Mrs.
Johnson</i>, from which passages have already been quoted.&nbsp;
He there calls her &ldquo;the truest, most virtuous and valuable
friend that I, or perhaps any other person, was ever blessed
with.&rdquo;&nbsp; Combined with excellent gifts of the mind,
&ldquo;she had a gracefulness, somewhat more than human, in every
motion, word, and action.&nbsp; Never was so happy a conjunction
of civility, freedom, easiness, and sincerity.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Everyone treated her with marked respect, yet everyone was at
ease in her society.&nbsp; She preserved her wit, judgment, and
vivacity to the last, but often complained of her memory.&nbsp;
She chose men rather than women for her companions, &ldquo;the
usual topic of ladies&rsquo; discourse being such as she had
little knowledge of and less relish.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Honour,
truth, liberality, good nature, and modesty were the virtues she
chiefly possessed, and most valued in her
acquaintance.&rdquo;&nbsp; In some Prayers used by Swift during
her last sickness, he begged for pity for &ldquo;the mournful
friends of Thy distressed servant, who sink under the weight of
her present condition, and the fear of losing the most valuable
of our friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was too ill to be present at the
funeral at St. Patrick&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Afterwards, we are told, a
lock of her hair was found in his desk, wrapped in a paper
bearing the words, &ldquo;Only a woman&rsquo;s hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swift continued to produce pamphlets manifesting growing
misanthropy, though he showed many kindnesses to people who stood
in need of help.&nbsp; He seems to have given Mrs. Dingley fifty
guineas a year, pretending that it came from a fund for which he
was trustee.&nbsp; The mental decay which he had always
feared&mdash;&ldquo;I shall be like that tree,&rdquo; he once
said, &ldquo;I shall die at the top&rdquo;&mdash;became marked
about 1738.&nbsp; Paralysis was followed by aphasia, and after
acute pain, followed by a long period of apathy, death <a
name="pagexxix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxix</span>relieved
him in October 1745.&nbsp; He was buried by Stella&rsquo;s side,
in accordance with his wishes.&nbsp; The bulk of his fortune was
left to found a hospital for idiots and lunatics.</p>
<p>There has been much rather fruitless discussion respecting the
reason or reasons why Swift did not marry Stella; for if there
was any marriage, it was nothing more than a form.&nbsp; Some
have supposed that Swift resolved to remain unmarried because the
insanity of an uncle and the fits and giddiness to which he was
always subject led him to fear insanity in his own case.&nbsp;
Others, looking rather to physical causes, have dwelt upon his
coldness of temperament and indisposition to love; upon the
repugnance he often showed towards marriage, and the tone of some
of the verses on the subject written in his later years.&nbsp;
Others, again, have found a cause in his parsimonious habits, in
his dread of poverty, the effects of which he had himself felt,
and in the smallness of his income, at least until he was
middle-aged. <a name="citation0l"></a><a href="#footnote0l"
class="citation">[0l]</a>&nbsp; It may well be that one or all of
these things influenced Swift&rsquo;s action.&nbsp; We cannot say
more.&nbsp; He himself, as we have seen, said, as early as 1704,
that if his humour and means had permitted him to think of
marriage, his choice would have been Stella.&nbsp; Perhaps,
however, there is not much mystery in the matter.&nbsp; Swift
seems to have been wanting in passion; probably he was satisfied
with the affection which Stella gave him, and did not wish for
more.&nbsp; Such an attachment as his usually results in
marriage, but not necessarily.&nbsp; It is not sufficiently
remembered that the affection began in Stella&rsquo;s
childhood.&nbsp; They were &ldquo;perfect friends&rdquo; for
nearly forty years, and her advancing years in no way lessened
his love, which was independent of beauty.&nbsp; <a
name="pagexxx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxx</span>Whether
Stella was satisfied, who shall say?&nbsp; Mrs. Oliphant thought
that few women would be disposed to pity Stella, or think her
life one of blight or injury.&nbsp; Mr. Leslie Stephen says,
&ldquo;She might and probably did regard his friendship as a full
equivalent for the sacrifice. . . .&nbsp; Is it better to be the
most intimate friend of a man of genius or the wife of a
commonplace Tisdall?&rdquo;&nbsp; Whatever we may surmise, there
is nothing to prove that she was disappointed.&nbsp; She was the
one star which brightened Swift&rsquo;s storm-tossed course; it
is well that she was spared seeing the wreck at the end.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The <i>Journal to Stella</i> is interesting from many points
of view: for its bearing upon Swift&rsquo;s relations with Stella
and upon his own character; for the light which it throws upon
the history of the time and upon prominent men of the day; and
for the illustrations it contains of the social life of people of
various classes in London and elsewhere.&nbsp; The fact that it
was written without any thought of publication is one of its
greatest attractions.&nbsp; Swift jotted down his opinions, his
hopes, his disappointments, without thought of their being seen
by anybody but his correspondents.&nbsp; The letters are
transparently natural.&nbsp; It has been said more than once that
the <i>Journal</i>, by the nature of the case, contains no
full-length portraits, and hardly any sketches.&nbsp; Swift
mentions the people he met, but rarely stops to draw a picture of
them.&nbsp; But though this is true, the casual remarks which he
makes often give a vivid impression of what he thought of the
person of whom he is speaking, and in many cases those few words
form a chief part of our general estimate of the man.&nbsp; There
are but few people of note at the time who are not mentioned in
these pages.&nbsp; We see Queen Anne holding a Drawing-room in
her bedroom: &ldquo;she looked at us round with her fan in her
mouth, <a name="pagexxxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxi</span>and once a minute said about three words to some that
were nearest her.&rdquo;&nbsp; We see Harley, afterwards the Earl
of Oxford, &ldquo;a pure trifler,&rdquo; who was always putting
off important business; Bolingbroke, &ldquo;a thorough
rake&rdquo;; the prudent Lord Dartmouth, the other Secretary of
State, from whom Swift could never &ldquo;work out a
dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is Marlborough, &ldquo;covetous as
Hell, and ambitious as the prince of it,&rdquo; yet a great
general and unduly pressed by the Tories; and the volatile Earl
of Peterborough, &ldquo;above fifty, and as active as one of
five-and-twenty&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the ramblingest lying rogue
on earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; We meet poor Congreve, nearly blind, and
in fear of losing his commissionership; the kindly Arbuthnot, the
Queen&rsquo;s physician; Addison, whom Swift met more and more
rarely, busy with the preparation and production of <i>Cato</i>;
Steele, careless as ever, neglecting important appointments, and
&ldquo;governed by his wife most abominably&rdquo;; Prior, poet
and diplomatist, with a &ldquo;lean carcass&rdquo;; and young
Berkeley of Trinity College, Dublin, &ldquo;a very ingenious man
and great philosopher,&rdquo; whom Swift determined to favour as
much as he could.&nbsp; Mrs. Masham, the Duchess of Somerset, the
Duchess of Shrewsbury, the Duchess of Hamilton, Lady Betty
Germaine, and many other ladies appear with more or less
distinctness; besides a host of people of less note, of whom we
often know little but what Swift tells us.</p>
<p>Swift throws much light, too, on the daily life of his
time.&nbsp; The bellman on his nightly rounds, calling
&ldquo;Paaast twelvvve o&rsquo;clock&rdquo;; the dinner at three,
or at the latest, four; the meetings at coffee-houses; the
book-sales; the visit to the London sights&mdash;the lions at the
Tower, Bedlam, the tombs in Westminster Abbey, and the
puppet-show; the terrible Mohocks, of whom Swift stood in so much
fear; the polite &ldquo;howdees&rdquo; sent to friends by
footmen; these <a name="pagexxxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxii</span>and more are all described in the
<i>Journal</i>.&nbsp; We read of curious habits and practices of
fashionable ladies; of the snuff used by Mrs. Dingley and others;
of the jokes&mdash;&ldquo;bites,&rdquo; puns, and the
like&mdash;indulged in by polite persons.&nbsp; When Swift lodged
at Chelsea, he reached London either by boat, or by
coach,&mdash;which was sometimes full when he wanted it,&mdash;or
by walking across the &ldquo;Five Fields,&rdquo; not without fear
of robbers at night.&nbsp; The going to or from Ireland was a
serious matter; after the long journey by road came the voyage
(weather permitting) of some fifteen hours, with the risk of
being seized or pursued by French privateers; and when Ireland
was reached the roads were of the worst.&nbsp; We have glimpses
of fashionable society in Dublin, of the quiet life at Laracor
and Trim, and of the drinking of the waters at Wexford, where
visitors had to put up with primitive arrangements: &ldquo;Mrs.
Dingley never saw such a place in her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swift&rsquo;s own characteristics come out in the clearest
manner in the <i>Journal</i>, which gives all his hopes and fears
during three busy years.&nbsp; He was pleased to find on his
arrival in London how great a value was set on his friendship by
both political parties: &ldquo;The Whigs were ravished to see me,
and would lay hold on me as a twig while they are
drowning;&rdquo; but Godolphin&rsquo;s coldness enraged him, so
that he was &ldquo;almost vowing vengeance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Next day
he talked treason heartily against the Whigs, their baseness and
ingratitude, and went home full of schemes of revenge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Tories drily tell me I may make my fortune, if I
please; but I do not understand them, or rather, I <i>do</i>
understand them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He realised that the Tories might
not be more grateful than others, but he thought they were
pursuing the true interests of the public, and was glad to
contribute what was in his power.&nbsp; His vanity was gratified
by Harley inviting him to the private dinners with St. <a
name="pagexxxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxiii</span>John
and Harcourt which were given on Saturdays, and by their calling
him Jonathan; but he did not hope too much from their friendship:
&ldquo;I said I believed they would leave me Jonathan, as they
found me . . . but I care not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of Swift&rsquo;s frugal habits there is abundant evidence in
the <i>Journal</i>.&nbsp; When he came to town he took rooms on a
first floor, &ldquo;a dining-room and bed-chamber, at eight
shillings a week; plaguy dear, but I spend nothing for eating,
never go to a tavern, and very seldom in a coach; yet after all
it will be expensive.&rdquo;&nbsp; In November he mentions that
he had a fire: &ldquo;I am spending my second half-bushel of
coals.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another place he says, &ldquo;People have
so left the town, that I am at a loss for a dinner. . . .&nbsp;
It cost me eighteenpence in coach-hire before I could find a
place to dine in.&rdquo;&nbsp; Elsewhere we find: &ldquo;This
paper does not cost me a farthing: I have it from the
Secretary&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;&nbsp; He often complains of
having to take a coach owing to the dirty condition of the
streets: &ldquo;This rain ruins me in coach-hire; I walked away
sixpennyworth, and came within a shilling length, and then took a
coach, and got a lift back for nothing.&rdquo; <a
name="citation0m"></a><a href="#footnote0m"
class="citation">[0m]</a></p>
<p>Swift&rsquo;s arrogance&mdash;the arrogance, sometimes, of a
man who is morbidly suspicious that he may be patronised&mdash;is
shown in the manner in which he speaks of the grand ladies with
whom he came in contact.&nbsp; He calls the Duke of <a
name="pagexxxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxiv</span>Ormond&rsquo;s daughters &ldquo;insolent
drabs,&rdquo; and talks of his &ldquo;mistress, Ophy
Butler&rsquo;s wife, who is grown a little
charmless.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the Duchess of Shrewsbury reproached
him for not dining with her, Swift said that was not so soon
done; he expected more advances from ladies, especially
duchesses.&nbsp; On another occasion he was to have supped at
Lady Ashburnham&rsquo;s, &ldquo;but the drab did not call for us
in her coach, as she promised, but sent for us, and so I sent my
excuses.&rdquo;&nbsp; The arrogance was, however, often only on
the surface.&nbsp; It is evident that Swift was very kind in many
cases.&nbsp; He felt deeply for Mrs. Long in her misfortunes,
living and dying in an obscure country town.&nbsp; On the last
illness of the poet Harrison he says, &ldquo;I am very much
afflicted for him, as he is my own creature. . . .&nbsp; I was
afraid to knock at the door; my mind misgave me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was &ldquo;heartily sorry for poor Mrs. Parnell&rsquo;s death;
she seemed to be an excellent good-natured young woman, and I
believe the poor lad is much afflicted; they appeared to live
perfectly well together.&rdquo;&nbsp; Afterwards he helped
Parnell by introducing him to Bolingbroke and Oxford.&nbsp; He
found kind words for Mrs. Manley in her illness, and Lady
Ashburnham&rsquo;s death was &ldquo;extremely moving. . . .&nbsp;
She was my greatest favourite, and I am in excessive concern for
her loss.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lastly, he was extraordinarily patient
towards his servant Patrick, who drank, stopped out at night, and
in many ways tried Swift&rsquo;s temper.&nbsp; There were good
points about Patrick, but no doubt the great consideration which
Swift showed him was due in part to the fact that he was a
favourite of the ladies in Dublin, and had Mrs. Vanhomrigh to
intercede for him.</p>
<p>But for the best example of the kindly side of Swift&rsquo;s
nature, we must turn to what he tells us in the <i>Journal</i>
about Stella herself.&nbsp; The &ldquo;little language&rdquo;
which Swift used when writing to her was the language he employed
<a name="pagexxxv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxv</span>when
playing with Stella as a little child at Moor Park.&nbsp;
Thackeray, who was not much in sympathy with Swift, said that he
knew of &ldquo;nothing more manly, more tender, more exquisitely
touching, than some of these notes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Swift says that
when he wrote plainly, he felt as if they were no longer alone,
but &ldquo;a bad scrawl is so snug it looks like a
PMD.&rdquo;&nbsp; In writing his fond and playful prattle, he
made up his mouth &ldquo;just as if he were speaking it.&rdquo;
<a name="citation0n"></a><a href="#footnote0n"
class="citation">[0n]</a></p>
<p>Though Mrs. Dingley is constantly associated with Stella in
the affectionate greetings in the <i>Journal</i>, she seems to
have been included merely as a cloak to enable him to express the
more freely his affection for her companion.&nbsp; Such phrases
as &ldquo;saucy girls,&rdquo; &ldquo;sirrahs,&rdquo;
&ldquo;sauceboxes,&rdquo; and the like, are often applied to
both; and sometimes Swift certainly writes as if the one were as
dear to him as the other; thus we find, &ldquo;Farewell, my
dearest lives and delights, I love you better than ever, if
possible, as hope saved, I do, and ever will. . . .&nbsp; I can
count upon nothing, nor will, but upon MD&rsquo;s love and
kindness. . . .&nbsp; And so farewell, dearest MD, Stella,
Dingley, Presto, all together, now and for ever, all
together.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as a rule, notwithstanding
Swift&rsquo;s caution, the greetings intended for Stella alone
are easily distinguishable in tone.&nbsp; He often refers to her
weak eyes and delicate health.&nbsp; Thus he writes, &ldquo;The
chocolate is a present, madam, for Stella.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t read
this, you little rogue, with your little eyes; but give it to
Dingley, pray now; and I will write as plain as the <a
name="pagexxxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxvi</span>skies.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;God Almighty
bless poor Stella, and her eyes and head: what shall we do to
cure them, poor dear life?&rdquo;&nbsp; Or, &ldquo;Now to
Stella&rsquo;s little postscript; and I am almost crazed that you
vex yourself for not writing.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you dictate to
Dingley, and not strain your dear little eyes?&nbsp; I am sure
&rsquo;tis the grief of my soul to think you are out of
order.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had been keeping his birthday; Swift
wished he had been with them, rather than in London, where he had
no manner of pleasure: &ldquo;I say Amen with all my heart and
vitals, that we may never be asunder again ten days together
while poor Presto lives.&rdquo;&nbsp; A few days later he says,
&ldquo;I wish I were at Laracor, with dear charming MD,&rdquo;
and again, &ldquo;Farewell, dearest beloved MD, and love poor
poor Presto, who has not had one happy day since he left
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will say no more, but beg you to be
easy till Fortune takes his course, and to believe MD&rsquo;s
felicity is the great goal I aim at in all my
pursuits.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How does Stella look, Madam
Dingley?&rdquo; he asks; &ldquo;pretty well, a handsome young
woman still?&nbsp; Will she pass in a crowd?&nbsp; Will she make
a figure in a country church?&rdquo;&nbsp; Elsewhere he writes,
on receipt of a letter, &ldquo;God Almighty bless poor dear
Stella, and send her a great many birthdays, all happy and
healthy and wealthy, and with me ever together, and never asunder
again, unless by chance. . . .&nbsp; I can hardly imagine you
absent when I am reading your letter or writing to you.&nbsp; No,
faith, you are just here upon this little paper, and therefore I
see and talk with you every evening constantly, and sometimes in
the morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; The letters lay under Swift&rsquo;s
pillow, and he fondled them as if he were caressing
Stella&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Of Stella herself we naturally have no direct account in the
<i>Journal</i>, but we hear a good deal of her life in Ireland,
and can picture what she was.&nbsp; Among her friends in and
about Trim and Laracor were Dr. Raymond, the vicar of <a
name="pagexxxvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxvii</span>Trim,
and his wife, the Garret Wesleys, the Percevals, and Mr.
Warburton, Swift&rsquo;s curate.&nbsp; At Dublin there were
Archdeacon Walls and his family; Alderman Stoyte, his wife and
sister-in-law; Dean Sterne and the Irish Postmaster-General,
Isaac Manley.&nbsp; For years these friends formed a club which
met in Dublin at each other&rsquo;s houses, to sup and play cards
(&ldquo;ombre and claret, and toasted oranges&rdquo;), and we
have frequent allusions to Stella&rsquo;s indifferent play, and
the money which she lost, much to Mrs. Dingley&rsquo;s chagrin:
&ldquo;Poor Dingley fretted to see Stella lose that four and
elevenpence t&rsquo;other night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Dingley
herself could hardly play well enough to hold the cards while
Stella went into the next room.&nbsp; If at dinner the mutton was
underdone, and &ldquo;poor Stella cannot eat, poor dear
rogue,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Dingley is so vexed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Swift
was for ever urging Stella to walk and ride; she was
&ldquo;naturally a stout walker,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dingley would
do well enough if her petticoats were pinned up.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
we see Stella setting out on and returning from her ride, with
her riband and mask: &ldquo;Ah, that riding to Laracor gives me
short sighs as well as you,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;all the days I
have passed here have been dirt to those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the <i>Journal</i> shows us some of Swift&rsquo;s less
attractive qualities, it shows still more how great a store of
humour, tenderness, and affection there was in him.&nbsp; In
these letters we see his very soul; in his literary work we are
seldom moved to anything but admiration of his wit and
genius.&nbsp; Such daily outpourings could never have been
written for publication, they were meant only for one who
understood him perfectly; and everything that we know of
Stella&mdash;her kindliness, her wit, her vivacity, her
loyalty&mdash;shows that she was worthy of the confidence.</p>

<h3>LETTER II.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Sept.</i> 9, 1710.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">got</span> here last Thursday, <a
name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a> after five days&rsquo; travelling,
weary the first, almost dead the second, tolerable the third, and
well enough the rest; and am now glad of the fatigue, which has
served for exercise; and I am at present well enough.&nbsp; The
Whigs were ravished to see me, and would lay hold on <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>me as a twig
while they are drowning, <a name="citation4b"></a><a
href="#footnote4b" class="citation">[4b]</a> and the great men
making me their clumsy apologies, etc.&nbsp; But my Lord
Treasurer <a name="citation4c"></a><a href="#footnote4c"
class="citation">[4c]</a> received me with a great deal of
coldness, which has enraged me so, I am almost vowing
revenge.&nbsp; I have not yet gone half my circle; but I find all
my acquaintance just as I left them.&nbsp; I hear my Lady Giffard
<a name="citation4d"></a><a href="#footnote4d"
class="citation">[4d]</a> is much at Court, and Lady Wharton <a
name="citation4e"></a><a href="#footnote4e"
class="citation">[4e]</a> was ridiculing it t&rsquo;other day; so
I have lost a friend there.&nbsp; I have not yet seen her, nor
intend it; but I will contrive to see Stella&rsquo;s mother <a
name="citation4f"></a><a href="#footnote4f"
class="citation">[4f]</a> some other way.&nbsp; I writ to the
Bishop of Clogher from Chester; and I now write to the Archbishop
of Dublin. <a name="citation4g"></a><a href="#footnote4g"
class="citation">[4g]</a>&nbsp; Everything is turning upside
down; every Whig in great office will, to a man, be infallibly
put out; and we shall have such a winter as hath not been seen in
England.&nbsp; Everybody asks me, how I came to be so long in
Ireland, as naturally as if here were my being; but no soul
offers to make it so: and I protest I shall return to Dublin, and
the Canal at Laracor, <a name="citation4h"></a><a
href="#footnote4h" class="citation">[4h]</a> with more <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>satisfaction
than ever I did in my life.&nbsp; The Tatler <a
name="citation5a"></a><a href="#footnote5a"
class="citation">[5a]</a> expects every day to be turned out of
his employment; and the Duke of Ormond, <a
name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b"
class="citation">[5b]</a> they say, will be Lieutenant of
Ireland.&nbsp; I hope you are now peaceably in Presto&rsquo;s <a
name="citation5c"></a><a href="#footnote5c"
class="citation">[5c]</a> lodgings; but I resolve to turn you out
by Christmas; in which time I shall either do my business, or
find it not to be done.&nbsp; Pray be at Trim by the time this
letter comes to you; and ride little Johnson, who must needs be
now in good case.&nbsp; I have begun this letter unusually, on
the post-night, and have already written to the Archbishop; and
cannot lengthen this.&nbsp; Henceforth I will write something
every day to MD, and make it a sort of journal; and when it is
full, I will send it, whether MD writes or no; and so that will
be pretty: and I shall always be in conversation with MD, and MD
with Presto.&nbsp; Pray make Parvisol pay you the ten pounds
immediately; so I ordered him.&nbsp; They tell me I am grown
fatter, and look better; and, on Monday, Jervas <a
name="citation5d"></a><a href="#footnote5d"
class="citation">[5d]</a> is to retouch my picture.&nbsp; I
thought I saw Jack Temple <a name="citation5e"></a><a
href="#footnote5e" class="citation">[5e]</a> and his wife pass by
me to-day in their coach; but I took no notice of them.&nbsp; I
am glad I have wholly shaken off that family.&nbsp; Tell the
Provost, <a name="citation5f"></a><a href="#footnote5f"
class="citation">[5f]</a> I have obeyed his commands to the Duke
of <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Ormond;
or let it alone, if you please.&nbsp; I saw Jemmy Leigh <a
name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a"
class="citation">[6a]</a> just now at the Coffee-house, who asked
after you with great kindness: he talks of going in a fortnight
to Ireland.&nbsp; My service to the Dean, <a
name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a> and Mrs. Walls, and her Archdeacon. <a

class="citation">[6c]</a>&nbsp; Will Frankland&rsquo;s <a
name="citation6d"></a><a href="#footnote6d"
class="citation">[6d]</a> wife is near bringing to-bed, and I
have promised to christen the child.&nbsp; I fancy you had my
Chester letter the Tuesday after I writ.&nbsp; I presented Dr.
Raymond to Lord Wharton <a name="citation6e"></a><a
href="#footnote6e" class="citation">[6e]</a> at Chester.&nbsp;
Pray let me know when Joe gets his money. <a
name="citation6f"></a><a href="#footnote6f"
class="citation">[6f]</a>&nbsp; It is near ten, and I hate to
send by the bellman. <a name="citation6g"></a><a

a longer letter in a week, but I send this only to tell I am safe
in London; and so farewell, etc.</p>

III.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Sept.</i> 9, 1710.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> seeing the Duke of Ormond,
dining with Dr. Cockburn, <a name="citation7a"></a><a
href="#footnote7a" class="citation">[7a]</a> passing some part of
the afternoon with Sir Matthew Dudley <a name="citation7b"></a><a
href="#footnote7b" class="citation">[7b]</a> and Will Frankland,
the rest at St. James&rsquo;s Coffee-house, I came home, and writ
to the Archbishop of Dublin and MD, and am going to bed.&nbsp; I
forgot to tell you, that I begged Will Frankland to stand
Manley&rsquo;s <a name="citation7c"></a><a href="#footnote7c"
class="citation">[7c]</a> friend with his father in this shaking
season for places.&nbsp; He told me, his father was in danger to
be out; that several were now soliciting for Manley&rsquo;s
place; that he was accused of opening letters; that Sir Thomas
Frankland <a name="citation7d"></a><a href="#footnote7d"
class="citation">[7d]</a> would sacrifice everything to save
himself; and in that, I fear, Manley is undone, etc.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; To-day I dined with Lord Mountjoy at Kensington; saw
my mistress, Ophy Butler&rsquo;s <a name="citation7e"></a><a
href="#footnote7e" class="citation">[7e]</a> wife, who is grown a
little charmless.&nbsp; I sat till ten in the evening with
Addison and <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Steele: Steele will certainly lose his Gazetteer&rsquo;s
place, all the world detesting his engaging in parties. <a
name="citation8a"></a><a href="#footnote8a"
class="citation">[8a]</a>&nbsp; At ten I went to the
Coffee-house, hoping to find Lord Radnor, <a
name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b"
class="citation">[8b]</a> whom I had not seen.&nbsp; He was
there; and for an hour and a half we talked treason heartily
against the Whigs, their baseness and ingratitude.&nbsp; And I am
come home, rolling resentments in my mind, and framing schemes of
revenge: full of which (having written down some hints) I go to
bed.&nbsp; I am afraid MD dined at home, because it is Sunday;
and there was the little half-pint of wine: for God&rsquo;s sake,
be good girls, and all will be well.&nbsp; Ben Tooke <a
name="citation8c"></a><a href="#footnote8c"
class="citation">[8c]</a> was with me this morning.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Seven, morning.&nbsp; I am rising to go to Jervas to
finish my picture, and &rsquo;tis shaving-day, so good-morrow MD;
but don&rsquo;t keep me now, for I can&rsquo;t stay; and pray
dine with the Dean, but don&rsquo;t lose your money.&nbsp; I long
to hear from you, etc.&mdash;Ten at night.&nbsp; I sat four hours
this morning to Jervas, who has given my picture quite another
turn, and now approves it entirely; but we must have the
approbation of the town.&nbsp; If I were rich enough, I would get
a copy of it, and bring it over.&nbsp; Mr. Addison and I dined
together at his lodgings, and I sat with him part of this
evening; and I am now come home to write an hour.&nbsp; Patrick
<a name="citation8d"></a><a href="#footnote8d"
class="citation">[8d]</a> observes, that the rabble here are much
more inquisitive in politics than in Ireland.&nbsp; Every day we
expect changes, and the Parliament to be dissolved.&nbsp; Lord
Wharton expects every day to be out: he is working like a horse
for elections; and, in short, I never saw so great a ferment
among all sorts of people.&nbsp; I had a miserable letter from
Joe last <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Saturday, telling me Mr. Pratt <a
name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"
class="citation">[9a]</a> refuses payment of his money.&nbsp; I
have told it Mr. Addison, and will to Lord Wharton; but I fear
with no success.&nbsp; However, I will do all I can.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; To-day I presented Mr. Ford <a
name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a> to the Duke of Ormond; and paid my
first visit to Lord President, <a name="citation9c"></a><a
href="#footnote9c" class="citation">[9c]</a> with whom I had much
discourse; but put him always off when he began to talk of Lord
Wharton in relation to me, till he urged it: then I said, he knew
I never expected anything from Lord Wharton, and that Lord
Wharton knew that I understood it so.&nbsp; He said that he had
written twice to Lord Wharton about me, who both times said
nothing at all to that part of his letter.&nbsp; I am advised not
to meddle in the affair of the First-Fruits, till this hurry is a
little over, which still depends, and we are all in the
dark.&nbsp; Lord President told me he expects every day to be
out, and has done so these two months.&nbsp; I protest, upon my
life, I am heartily weary of this town, and wish I had never
stirred.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; I went this morning to the city, to see Mr.
Stratford the Hamburg merchant, my old schoolfellow; <a
name="citation9d"></a><a href="#footnote9d"
class="citation">[9d]</a> but calling at Bull&rsquo;s <a
name="citation9e"></a><a href="#footnote9e"
class="citation">[9e]</a> on Ludgate Hill, he forced me to his
house at Hampstead to dinner among a great deal of ill company;
among the rest Mr. Hoadley, <a name="citation9f"></a><a
href="#footnote9f" class="citation">[9f]</a> the Whig clergyman,
so famous for acting the contrary part to Sacheverell: <a
name="citation9g"></a><a href="#footnote9g"
class="citation">[9g]</a> but to-morrow <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>I design
again to see Stratford.&nbsp; I was glad, however, to be at
Hampstead, where I saw Lady Lucy <a name="citation10a"></a><a
href="#footnote10a" class="citation">[10a]</a> and Moll
Stanhope.&nbsp; I hear very unfortunate news of Mrs. Long; <a
name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a> she and her comrade <a
name="citation10c"></a><a href="#footnote10c"
class="citation">[10c]</a> have broke up house, and she is broke
for good and all, and is gone to the country: I should be
extremely sorry if this be true.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; To-day, I saw Patty Rolt, <a
name="citation10d"></a><a href="#footnote10d"
class="citation">[10d]</a> who heard I was in town; and I dined
with Stratford at a merchant&rsquo;s in the city, where I drank
the first Tokay wine I ever saw; and it is admirable, yet not to
the degree I expected.&nbsp; Stratford is worth a plum, <a
name="citation10e"></a><a href="#footnote10e"
class="citation">[10e]</a> and is now lending the Government
forty thousand pounds; yet we were educated together at the same
school and university. <a name="citation10f"></a><a
href="#footnote10f" class="citation">[10f]</a>&nbsp; We hear the
Chancellor <a name="citation10g"></a><a href="#footnote10g"
class="citation">[10g]</a> is to be suddenly <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>out, and Sir
Simon Harcourt <a name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a> to succeed him: I am come early home,
not caring for the Coffee-house.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; To-day Mr. Addison, Colonel Freind, <a
name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a> and I, went to see the million lottery
<a name="citation11c"></a><a href="#footnote11c"
class="citation">[11c]</a> drawn at Guildhall.&nbsp; The
jackanapes of bluecoat boys gave themselves such airs in pulling
out the tickets, and showed white hands open to the company, to
let us see there was no cheat.&nbsp; We dined at a country-house
near Chelsea, where Mr. Addison often retires; and to-night, at
the Coffee-house, we hear Sir Simon Harcourt is made Lord Keeper;
so that now we expect every moment the Parliament will be
dissolved; but I forgot that this letter will not go in three or
four days, and that my news will be stale, which I should
therefore put in the last paragraph.&nbsp; Shall I send this
letter before I hear from MD, or shall I keep it to
lengthen?&nbsp; I have not yet seen Stella&rsquo;s mother,
because I will not see Lady Giffard; but I will contrive to go
there when Lady Giffard is abroad.&nbsp; I forgot to mark my two
former letters; but I remember this is Number 3, and I have not
yet had Number 1 from MD; but I shall by Monday, which I reckon
will be just a fortnight after you had my first.&nbsp; I am
resolved to bring over a great deal of china.&nbsp; I loved it
mightily to-day. <a name="citation11d"></a><a href="#footnote11d"
class="citation">[11d]</a>&nbsp; What shall I bring?</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Sir John Holland, <a
name="citation11e"></a><a href="#footnote11e"
class="citation">[11e]</a> Comptroller of the Household, has sent
to desire my acquaintance: I have a <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>mind to refuse him, because he is a
Whig, and will, I suppose, be out among the rest; but he is a man
of worth and learning.&nbsp; Tell me, do you like this journal
way of writing?&nbsp; Is it not tedious and dull?</p>
<p>Night.&nbsp; I dined to-day with a cousin, a printer, <a
name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a> where Patty Rolt lodges, and then came
home, after a visit or two; and it has been a very insipid
day.&nbsp; Mrs. Long&rsquo;s misfortune is confirmed to me;
bailiffs were in her house; she retired to private lodgings;
thence to the country, nobody knows where: her friends leave
letters at some inn, and they are carried to her; and she writes
answers without dating them from any place.&nbsp; I swear, it
grieves me to the soul.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; To-day I dined six miles out of town, with Will
Pate, <a name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a> the learned woollen-draper; Mr.
Stratford went with me; six miles here is nothing: we left Pate
after sunset, and were here before it was dark.&nbsp; This letter
shall go on Tuesday, whether I hear from MD or no.&nbsp; My
health continues pretty well; pray God Stella may give me a good
account of hers! and I hope you are now at Trim, or soon
designing it.&nbsp; I was disappointed to-night: the fellow gave
me a letter, and I hoped to see little MD&rsquo;s hand; and it
was only to invite me to a venison pasty to-day: so I lost my
pasty into the bargain.&nbsp; Pox on these declining
courtiers!&nbsp; Here is Mr. Brydges, <a
name="citation12c"></a><a href="#footnote12c"
class="citation">[12c]</a> the Paymaster-General, desiring my
acquaintance; but I hear the Queen sent Lord Shrewsbury <a
name="citation12d"></a><a href="#footnote12d"
class="citation">[12d]</a> to assure him he may keep his place;
and he promises me <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>great assistance in the affair of the
First-Fruits.&nbsp; Well, I must turn over this leaf to-night,
though the side would hold another line; but pray consider this
is a whole sheet; it holds a plaguy deal, and you must be content
to be weary; but I&rsquo;ll do so no more.&nbsp; Sir Simon
Harcourt is made Attorney-General, and not Lord Keeper.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; To-day I dined with Mr. Stratford at Mr.
Addison&rsquo;s retirement near Chelsea; then came to town; got
home early, and began a letter to the <i>Tatler</i>, <a
name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a> about the corruptions of style and
writing, etc., and, having not heard from you, am resolved this
letter shall go to-night.&nbsp; Lord Wharton was sent for to town
in mighty haste, by the Duke of Devonshire: <a
name="citation13b"></a><a href="#footnote13b"
class="citation">[13b]</a> they have some project in hand; but it
will not do, for every hour we expect a thorough revolution, and
that the Parliament will be dissolved.&nbsp; When you see Joe,
tell him Lord Wharton is too busy to mind any of his affairs; but
I will get what good offices I can from Mr. Addison, and will
write to-day to Mr. Pratt; and bid Joe not to be discouraged, for
I am confident he will get the money under any Government; but he
must have patience.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; I have been scribbling this morning, and I believe
shall hardly fill this side to-day, but send it as it is; and it
is good enough for naughty girls that won&rsquo;t write to a
body, and to a good boy like Presto.&nbsp; I thought to have sent
this to-night, but was kept by company, and could not; and, to
say the truth, I had a little mind to expect one post more for a
letter from MD.&nbsp; Yesterday at noon died the Earl of
Anglesea, <a name="citation13c"></a><a href="#footnote13c"
class="citation">[13c]</a> the great support of the Tories; so
that employment of Vice-Treasurer of Ireland is again
vacant.&nbsp; We were <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>to have been great friends, and I
could hardly have a loss that could grieve me more.&nbsp; The
Bishop of Durham <a name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a> died the same day.&nbsp; The Duke of
Ormond&rsquo;s daughter <a name="citation14b"></a><a
href="#footnote14b" class="citation">[14b]</a> was to visit me
to-day at a third place by way of advance, <a
name="citation14c"></a><a href="#footnote14c"
class="citation">[14c]</a> and I am to return it to-morrow.&nbsp;
I have had a letter from Lady Berkeley, begging me for charity to
come to Berkeley Castle, for company to my lord, <a
name="citation14d"></a><a href="#footnote14d"
class="citation">[14d]</a> who has been ill of a dropsy; but I
cannot go, and must send my excuse to-morrow.&nbsp; I am told
that in a few hours there will be more removals.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; To-day I returned my visits to the Duke&rsquo;s
daughters; <a name="citation14e"></a><a href="#footnote14e"
class="citation">[14e]</a> the insolent drabs came up to my very
mouth to salute me.&nbsp; Then I heard the report confirmed of
removals; my Lord President Somers; the Duke of Devonshire, Lord
Steward; and Mr. Boyle, <a name="citation14f"></a><a
href="#footnote14f" class="citation">[14f]</a> Secretary of
State, are all turned out to-day.&nbsp; I never remember such
bold steps taken by a Court: I am almost shocked at it, though I
did not care if they were all hanged.&nbsp; We are astonished why
the Parliament is not yet dissolved, and why they keep a matter
of that importance to the last.&nbsp; We shall have a strange
winter here, between the struggles of a cunning provoked
discarded party, and the triumphs of one in power; of both which
I shall be an indifferent spectator, and return very peaceably to
Ireland, <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>when I have done my part in the affair I am entrusted
with, whether it succeeds or no.&nbsp; To-morrow I change my
lodgings in Pall Mall for one in Bury Street, <a
name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a"
class="citation">[15a]</a> where I suppose I shall continue while
I stay in London.&nbsp; If anything happens to-morrow, I will add
it.&mdash;Robin&rsquo;s Coffee-house. <a
name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b"
class="citation">[15b]</a>&nbsp; We have great news just now from
Spain; Madrid taken, and Pampeluna.&nbsp; I am here ever
interrupted.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; I have just received your letter, which I will not
answer now; God be thanked all things are so well.&nbsp; I find
you have not yet had my second: I had a letter from Parvisol, who
tells me he gave Mrs. Walls a bill of twenty pounds for me, to be
given to you; but you have not sent it.&nbsp; This night the
Parliament is dissolved: great news from Spain; King Charles and
Stanhope are at Madrid, and Count Staremberg has taken
Pampeluna.&nbsp; Farewell.&nbsp; This is from St. James&rsquo;s
Coffee-house.&nbsp; I will begin my answer to your letter
to-night, but not send it this week.&nbsp; Pray tell me whether
you like this journal way of writing.&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like
your reasons for not going to Trim.&nbsp; Parvisol tells me he
can sell your horse.&nbsp; Sell it, with a pox?&nbsp; Pray let
him know that he shall sell his soul as soon.&nbsp; What? sell
anything that Stella loves, and may sometimes ride? It is hers,
and let her do as she pleases: pray let him know this by the
first that you know goes to Trim.&nbsp; Let him sell my grey, and
be hanged.</p>
<h3>LETTER IV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Sept.</i> 21, 1710.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> must I begin another letter,
on a whole sheet, for fear saucy little MD should be angry, and
think <i>much</i> that the paper is too <i>little</i>.&nbsp; I
had your letter this night, as <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>told you just and no more in my last;
for this must be taken up in answering yours, saucebox.&nbsp; I
believe I told you where I dined to-day; and to-morrow I go out
of town for two days to dine with the same company on Sunday;
Molesworth <a name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a"
class="citation">[16a]</a> the Florence Envoy, Stratford, and
some others.&nbsp; I heard to-day that a gentlewoman from Lady
Giffard&rsquo;s house had been at the Coffee-house to inquire for
me.&nbsp; It was Stella&rsquo;s mother, I suppose.&nbsp; I shall
send her a penny-post letter <a name="citation16b"></a><a
href="#footnote16b" class="citation">[16b]</a> to-morrow, and
contrive to see her without hazarding seeing Lady Giffard, which
I will not do until she begs my pardon.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Hampstead with Lady Lucy, etc.,
and when I got home found a letter from Joe, with one enclosed to
Lord Wharton, which I will send to his Excellency, and second it
as well as I can; but to talk of getting the Queen&rsquo;s order
is a jest.&nbsp; Things are in such a combustion here, that I am
advised not to meddle yet in the affair I am upon, which concerns
the clergy of a whole kingdom; and does he think anybody will
trouble the Queen about Joe?&nbsp; We shall, I hope, get a
recommendation from the Lord Lieutenant to the trustees for the
linen business, and I hope that will do; and so I will write to
him in a few days, and he must have patience.&nbsp; This is an
answer to part of your letter as well as his.&nbsp; I lied; it is
to-morrow I go to the country, and I won&rsquo;t answer a bit
more of your letter yet.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; Here is such a stir and bustle with this little MD
of ours; I must be writing every night; I can&rsquo;t go to bed
without a word to them; I can&rsquo;t put out my candle till I
have bid them good-night: O Lord, O Lord!&nbsp; Well, I dined the
first time to-day, with Will Frankland and his fortune: <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>she is not
very handsome.&nbsp; Did I not say I would go out of town
to-day?&nbsp; I hate lying abroad and clutter; I go to-morrow in
Frankland&rsquo;s chariot, and come back at night.&nbsp; Lady
Berkeley has invited me to Berkeley Castle, and Lady Betty
Germaine <a name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a"
class="citation">[17a]</a> to Drayton in Northamptonshire; and
I&rsquo;ll go to neither.&nbsp; Let me alone, I must finish my
pamphlet.&nbsp; I have sent a long letter to Bickerstaff: <a
name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b"
class="citation">[17b]</a> let the Bishop of Clogher smoke <a
name="citation17c"></a><a href="#footnote17c"
class="citation">[17c]</a> it if he can.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll
write to the Bishop of Killala; but you might have told him how
sudden and unexpected my journey was though.&nbsp; Deuce take
Lady S&mdash;; and if I know D&mdash;y, he is a rawboned-faced
fellow, not handsome, nor visibly so young as you say: she
sacrifices two thousand pounds a year, and keeps only six
hundred.&nbsp; Well, you have had all my land journey in my
second letter, and so much for that.&nbsp; So, you have got into
Presto&rsquo;s lodgings; very fine, truly!&nbsp; We have had a
fortnight of the most glorious weather on earth, and still
continues: I hope you have made the best of it.&nbsp; Ballygall
<a name="citation17d"></a><a href="#footnote17d"
class="citation">[17d]</a> will be a pure <a
name="citation17e"></a><a href="#footnote17e"
class="citation">[17e]</a> good place for air, if Mrs. Ashe makes
good her promise.&nbsp; Stella writes like an emperor: I am
afraid it hurts your eyes; take care of that pray, pray, Mrs.
Stella.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you do what you will with your own
horse?&nbsp; Pray don&rsquo;t let that puppy Parvisol sell
him.&nbsp; Patrick is drunk about three times a week, and I bear
it, and he has got the better of me; but one of these days I will
positively turn him off to the wide <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>world, when none of you are by to
intercede for him.&mdash;Stuff&mdash;how can I get her husband
into the Charter-house? get a &mdash; into the
Charter-house.&mdash;Write constantly!&nbsp; Why, sirrah,
don&rsquo;t I write every day, and sometimes twice a day to
MD?&nbsp; Now I have answered all your letter, and the rest must
be as it can be: send me my bill.&nbsp; Tell Mrs. Brent <a
name="citation18a"></a><a href="#footnote18a"
class="citation">[18a]</a> what I say of the Charter-house.&nbsp;
I think this enough for one night; and so farewell till this time
to-morrow.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; To-day I dined six miles out of town at Will
Pate&rsquo;s, with Stratford, Frankland, and the Molesworths, <a
name="citation18b"></a><a href="#footnote18b"
class="citation">[18b]</a> and came home at night, and was weary
and lazy.&nbsp; I can say no more now, but good-night.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; I was so lazy to-day that I dined at next door, <a
name="citation18c"></a><a href="#footnote18c"
class="citation">[18c]</a> and have sat at home since six,
writing to the Bishop of Clogher, Dean Sterne, and Mr. Manley:
the last, because I am in fear for him about his place, and have
sent him my opinion, what I and his other friends here think he
ought to do.&nbsp; I hope he will take it well.&nbsp; My advice
was, to keep as much in favour as possible with Sir Thomas
Frankland, his master here.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; Smoke how I widen the margin by lying in bed when I
write.&nbsp; My bed lies on the wrong side for me, so that I am
forced often to write when I am up.&nbsp; Manley, you must know,
has had people putting in for his place already; and has been
complained of for opening letters.&nbsp; Remember that last
Sunday, September 24, 1710, was as hot as midsummer.&nbsp; This
was written in the morning; it is now night, and Presto in
bed.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a clutter, I have gotten MD&rsquo;s
second letter, and I must answer it here.&nbsp; I gave the bill
to Tooke, and so&mdash;&nbsp; Well, I dined to-day with Sir John
Holland the Comptroller, and sat with him till eight; then came
home, and sent my letters, and writ part of a lampoon, <a
name="citation18d"></a><a href="#footnote18d"
class="citation">[18d]</a> which goes <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>on very slow: and now I am writing to
saucy MD; no wonder, indeed, good boys must write to naughty
girls.&nbsp; I have not seen your mother yet; my penny-post
letter, I suppose, miscarried: I will write another.&nbsp; Mr.
S&mdash; came to see me; and said M&mdash; was going to the
country next morning with her husband (who I find is a surly
brute); so I could only desire my service to her.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; To-day all our company dined at Will
Frankland&rsquo;s, with Steele and Addison too.&nbsp; This is the
first rainy day since I came to town; I cannot afford to answer
your letter yet.&nbsp; Morgan, <a name="citation19a"></a><a
href="#footnote19a" class="citation">[19a]</a> the puppy, writ me
a long letter, to desire I would recommend him for purse-bearer
or secretary to the next Lord Chancellor that would come with the
next Governor.&nbsp; I will not answer him; but beg you will say
these words to his father Raymond, <a name="citation19b"></a><a
href="#footnote19b" class="citation">[19b]</a> or anybody that
will tell him: That Dr. Swift has received his letter; and would
be very ready to serve him, but cannot do it in what he desires,
because he has no sort of interest in the persons to be applied
to.&nbsp; These words you may write, and let Joe, or Mr.
Warburton, <a name="citation19c"></a><a href="#footnote19c"
class="citation">[19c]</a> give them to him: a pox on him!&nbsp;
However, it is by these sort of ways that fools get
preferment.&nbsp; I must not end yet, because I cannot say
good-night without losing a line, and then MD would scold; but
now, good-night.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; I have the finest piece of Brazil tobacco for
Dingley that ever was born. <a name="citation19d"></a><a
href="#footnote19d" class="citation">[19d]</a>&nbsp; You talk of
Leigh; why, he won&rsquo;t be in Dublin these two months: he goes
to the country, then <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>returns to London, to see how the
world goes here in Parliament.&nbsp; Good-night, sirrahs; no, no,
not night; I writ this in the morning, and looking carelessly I
thought it had been of last night.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Mrs.
Barton <a name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a"
class="citation">[20a]</a> alone at her lodgings; where she told
me for certain, that Lady S&mdash; <a name="citation20b"></a><a
href="#footnote20b" class="citation">[20b]</a> was with child
when she was last in England, and pretended a tympany, and saw
everybody; then disappeared for three weeks, her tympany was
gone, and she looked like a ghost, etc.&nbsp; No wonder she
married when she was so ill at containing.&nbsp; Connolly <a
name="citation20c"></a><a href="#footnote20c"
class="citation">[20c]</a> is out; and Mr. Roberts in his place,
who loses a better here, but was formerly a Commissioner in
Ireland.&nbsp; That employment cost Connolly three thousand
pounds to Lord Wharton; so he has made one ill bargain in his
life.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; I wish MD a merry Michaelmas.&nbsp; I dined with Mr.
Addison, and Jervas the painter, at Addison&rsquo;s country
place; and then came home, and writ more to my lampoon.&nbsp; I
made a <i>Tatler</i> since I came: guess which it is, and whether
the Bishop of Clogher smokes it.&nbsp; I saw Mr. Sterne <a
name="citation20d"></a><a href="#footnote20d"
class="citation">[20d]</a> to-day: he will do as you order, and I
will give him chocolate for Stella&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; He goes
not these three weeks.&nbsp; I wish I could send it some other
way.&nbsp; So now to your letter, brave boys.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
like your way of saving shillings: nothing vexes me but that it
does not make Stella a coward in a coach. <a
name="citation20e"></a><a href="#footnote20e"
class="citation">[20e]</a> I <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>don&rsquo;t think any lady&rsquo;s
advice about my ear signifies twopence: however I will, in
compliance to you, ask Dr. Cockburn.&nbsp; Radcliffe <a
name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a"
class="citation">[21a]</a> I know not, and Barnard <a
name="citation21b"></a><a href="#footnote21b"
class="citation">[21b]</a> I never see.&nbsp; Walls will
certainly be stingier for seven years, upon pretence of his
robbery.&nbsp; So Stella puns again; why, &rsquo;tis well enough;
but I&rsquo;ll not second it, though I could make a dozen: I
never thought of a pun since I left Ireland.&mdash;Bishop of
Clogher&rsquo;s bill?&nbsp; Why, he paid it to me; do you think I
was such a fool to go without it?&nbsp; As for the four
shillings, I will give you a bill on Parvisol for it on
t&rsquo;other side of this paper; and pray tear off the two
letters I shall write to him and Joe, or let Dingley transcribe
and send them; though that to Parvisol, I believe, he must have
my hand for.&nbsp; No, no, I&rsquo;ll eat no grapes; I ate about
six the other day at Sir John Holland&rsquo;s; but would not give
sixpence for a thousand, they are so bad this year.&nbsp; Yes,
faith, I hope in God Presto and MD will be together this time
twelvemonth.&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Last year I suppose I was at
Laracor; but next I hope to eat my Michaelmas goose at my two
little gooses&rsquo; lodgings.&nbsp; I drink no <i>aile</i> (I
suppose you mean <i>ale</i>); but yet good wine every day, of
five and six shillings a bottle.&nbsp; O Lord, how much Stella
writes! pray don&rsquo;t carry that too far, young women, but be
temperate, to hold out.&nbsp; To-morrow I go to Mr. Harley. <a
name="citation21c"></a><a href="#footnote21c"
class="citation">[21c]</a> Why, small hopes from the Duke of
Ormond: he loves me very well, I believe, and would, in my turn,
give me something to make me easy; and I have good interest among
his best friends.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t think of anything
further than the business I am upon.&nbsp; You see I writ to
Manley <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>before I had your letter, and I fear he will be
out.&nbsp; Yes, Mrs. Owl, Bligh&rsquo;s corpse <a
name="citation22a"></a><a href="#footnote22a"
class="citation">[22a]</a> came to Chester when I was there; and
I told you so in my letter, or forgot it.&nbsp; I lodge in Bury
Street, where I removed a week ago.&nbsp; I have the first floor,
a dining-room, and bed-chamber, at eight shillings a week; plaguy
deep, but I spend nothing for eating, never go to a tavern, and
very seldom in a coach; yet after all it will be expensive.&nbsp;
Why do you trouble yourself, Mistress Stella, about my
instrument?&nbsp; I have the same the Archbishop gave me; and it
is as good now the bishops are away.&nbsp; The Dean friendly! the
Dean be poxed: a great piece of friendship indeed, what you heard
him tell the Bishop of Clogher; I wonder he had the face to talk
so: but he lent me money, and that&rsquo;s enough.&nbsp; Faith, I
would not send this these four days, only for writing to Joe and
Parvisol.&nbsp; Tell the Dean that when the bishops send me any
packets, they must not write to me at Mr. Steele&rsquo;s; but
direct for Mr. Steele, at his office at the Cockpit, and let the
enclosed be directed for me: that mistake cost me eighteenpence
the other day.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; I dined with Stratford to-day, but am not to see Mr.
Harley till Wednesday: it is late, and I send this before there
is occasion for the bell; because I would have Joe have his
letter, and Parvisol too; which you must so contrive as not to
cost them double postage.&nbsp; I can say no more, but that I am,
etc.</p>
<h3>LETTER V.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Sept.</i> 30, 1710.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Han&rsquo;t</span> I brought myself into a
fine <i>pr&aelig;munire</i>, <a name="citation22b"></a><a
href="#footnote22b" class="citation">[22b]</a> to begin writing
letters in whole sheets? and now I dare not leave it off.&nbsp; I
cannot tell whether you like these journal letters: I believe
they would be dull to me to read them <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>over; but, perhaps, little MD is
pleased to know how Presto passes his time in her absence.&nbsp;
I always begin my last the same day I ended my former.&nbsp; I
told you where I dined to-day at a tavern with Stratford: Lewis,
<a name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a"
class="citation">[23a]</a> who is a great favourite of
Harley&rsquo;s, was to have been with us; but he was hurried to
Hampton Court, and sent his excuse; and that next Wednesday he
would introduce me to Harley.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis good to see what a
lamentable confession the Whigs all make me of my ill usage: but
I mind them not.&nbsp; I am already represented to Harley as a
discontented person, that was used ill for not being Whig enough;
and I hope for good usage from him.&nbsp; The Tories drily tell
me, I may make my fortune, if I please; but I do not understand
them&mdash;or rather, I do understand them.</p>
<p>Oct. 1.&nbsp; To-day I dined at Molesworth&rsquo;s, the
Florence Envoy; and sat this evening with my friend Darteneuf, <a
name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a> whom you have heard me talk of; the
greatest punner of this town next myself.&nbsp; Have you smoked
the <i>Tatler</i> that I writ? <a name="citation23c"></a><a
href="#footnote23c" class="citation">[23c]</a>&nbsp; It is much
liked here, and I think it a pure <a name="citation23d"></a><a
href="#footnote23d" class="citation">[23d]</a> one.&nbsp;
To-morrow I go with Delaval, <a name="citation23e"></a><a

Envoy, to dine with Lord Halifax near Hampton Court. <a

class="citation">[24a]</a> and I am informed uses much interest
to preserve his brother: and, to-day, I spoke to the elder
Frankland to engage his father (Postmaster here); and I hope he
will be safe, although he is cruelly hated by all the Tories of
Ireland.&nbsp; I have almost finished my lampoon, and will print
it for revenge on a certain great person. <a

shillings in meat and drink since I came here, as thin as the

class="citation">[24c]</a> to desire him to engage Lady Hyde as
my mistress to engage Lord Hyde <a name="citation24d"></a><a
href="#footnote24d" class="citation">[24d]</a> in favour of Mr.
Pratt. <a name="citation24e"></a><a href="#footnote24e"
class="citation">[24e]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Lord Halifax was at Hampton Court at his lodgings,
and I dined with him there with Methuen, <a
name="citation24f"></a><a href="#footnote24f"
class="citation">[24f]</a> and Delaval, and the late
Attorney-General. <a name="citation24g"></a><a
href="#footnote24g" class="citation">[24g]</a>&nbsp; I went to
the Drawing-room <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>before dinner (for the Queen was at Hampton Court), and
expected to see nobody; but I met acquaintance enough.&nbsp; I
walked in the gardens, saw the cartoons of Raphael, and other
things; and with great difficulty got from Lord Halifax, who
would have kept me to-morrow to show me his house and park, and
improvements.&nbsp; We left Hampton Court at sunset, and got here
in a chariot and two horses time enough by starlight.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s something charms me mightily about London; that you
go dine a dozen miles off in October, stay all day, and return so
quickly: you cannot do anything like this in Dublin. <a
name="citation25a"></a><a href="#footnote25a"
class="citation">[25a]</a>&nbsp; I writ a second penny post
letter to your mother, and hear nothing of her.&nbsp; Did I tell
you that Earl Berkeley died last Sunday was se&rsquo;nnight, at
Berkeley Castle, of a dropsy?&nbsp; Lord Halifax began a health
to me to-day; it was the Resurrection of the Whigs, which I
refused unless he would add their Reformation too and I told him
he was the only Whig in England I loved, or had any good opinion
of.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; This morning Stella&rsquo;s sister <a
name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a> came to me with a letter from her
mother, who is at Sheen; but will soon be in town, and will call
to see me: she gave me a bottle of palsy water, <a
name="citation25c"></a><a href="#footnote25c"
class="citation">[25c]</a> a small one, and desired I would send
it you by the first convenience, as I will; and she promises a
quart bottle of the same: your sister looked very well, and seems
a good modest sort of girl.&nbsp; I went then to Mr. Lewis, first
secretary to Lord Dartmouth, <a name="citation25d"></a><a
href="#footnote25d" class="citation">[25d]</a> and favourite to
Mr. Harley, who is to introduce me to-morrow morning.&nbsp; Lewis
had with him one Mr. Dyot, <a name="citation25e"></a><a
href="#footnote25e" class="citation">[25e]</a> a Justice of
Peace, worth twenty thousand pounds, <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>a Commissioner of the Stamp Office,
and married to a sister of Sir Philip Meadows, <a
name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a> Envoy to the Emperor.&nbsp; I tell you
this, because it is odds but this Mr. Dyot will be hanged; for he
is discovered to have counterfeited stamped paper, in which he
was a Commissioner; and, with his accomplices, has cheated the
Queen of a hundred thousand pounds.&nbsp; You will hear of it
before this come to you, but may be not so particularly; and it
is a very odd accident in such a man.&nbsp; Smoke Presto writing
news to MD.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord Mountjoy at
Kensington, and walked from thence this evening to town like an
emperor.&nbsp; Remember that yesterday, October 2, was a cruel
hard frost, with ice; and six days ago I was dying with
heat.&nbsp; As thin as the town is, I have more dinners than
ever; and am asked this month by some people, without being able
to come for pre-engagements.&nbsp; Well, but I should write
plainer, when I consider Stella cannot read, <a
name="citation26b"></a><a href="#footnote26b"
class="citation">[26b]</a> and Dingley is not so skilful at my
ugly hand.&nbsp; I had to-night a letter from Mr. Pratt, who
tells me Joe will have his money when there are trustees
appointed by the Lord Lieutenant for receiving and disposing the
linen fund; and whenever those trustees are appointed, I will
solicit whoever is Lord Lieutenant, and am in no fear of
succeeding.&nbsp; So pray tell or write him word, and bid him not
be cast down; for Ned Southwell <a name="citation26c"></a><a
href="#footnote26c" class="citation">[26c]</a> and Mr. Addison
both think Pratt in the right.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t lose your money
at Manley&rsquo;s to-night, sirrahs.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; After I had put out my candle last night, my landlady
came into my room, with a servant of Lord Halifax, to desire I
would go dine with him at his house near Hampton Court; <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>but I sent
him word, I had business of great importance that hindered me,
etc.&nbsp; And to-day I was brought privately to Mr. Harley, who
received me with the greatest respect and kindness imaginable: he
has appointed me an hour on Saturday at four, afternoon, when I
will open my business to him; which expression I would not use if
I were a woman.&nbsp; I know you smoked it; but I did not till I
writ it.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Mr. Delaval&rsquo;s, the Envoy
for Portugal, with Nic Rowe <a name="citation27a"></a><a
href="#footnote27a" class="citation">[27a]</a> the poet, and
other friends; and I gave my lampoon to be printed.&nbsp; I have
more mischief in my heart; and I think it shall go round with
them all, as this hits, and I can find hints.&nbsp; I am certain
I answered your 2d letter, and yet I do not find it here.&nbsp; I
suppose it was in my 4th: and why N. 2d, 3d; is it not enough to
say, as I do, 1, 2, 3? etc.&nbsp; I am going to work at another
<i>Tatler</i>: <a name="citation27b"></a><a href="#footnote27b"
class="citation">[27b]</a>&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be far enough but I
say the same thing over two or three times, just as I do when I
am talking to little MD; but what care I? they can read it as
easily as I can write it: I think I have brought these lines
pretty straight again.&nbsp; I fear it will be long before I
finish two sides at this rate.&nbsp; Pray, dear MD, when I
occasionally give you any little commission mixed with my
letters, don&rsquo;t forget it, as that to Morgan and Joe, etc.,
for I write just as I can remember, otherwise I would put them
all together.&nbsp; I was to visit Mr. Sterne to-day, and give
him your commission about handkerchiefs: that of chocolate I will
do myself, and send it him when he goes, and you&rsquo;ll pay me
when <i>the giver&rsquo;s bread</i>, <a name="citation27c"></a><a
href="#footnote27c" class="citation">[27c]</a> etc.&nbsp;
To-night I will read a pamphlet, to amuse myself.&nbsp; God
preserve your dear healths!</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; This morning Delaval came to see me, and we went
together to Kneller&rsquo;s, <a name="citation27d"></a><a
href="#footnote27d" class="citation">[27d]</a> who was not in
town.&nbsp; In the way we met <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>the electors for Parliament-men: <a
name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a"
class="citation">[28a]</a> and the rabble came about our coach,
crying, &ldquo;A Colt, a Stanhope,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; We were
afraid of a dead cat, or our glasses broken, and so were always
of their side.&nbsp; I dined again at Delaval&rsquo;s; and in the
evening, at the Coffee-house, heard Sir Andrew Fountaine <a
name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b"
class="citation">[28b]</a> was come to town.&nbsp; This has been
but an insipid sort of day, and I have nothing to remark upon it
worth threepence: I hope MD had a better, with the Dean, the
Bishop, or Mrs. Walls. <a name="citation28c"></a><a
href="#footnote28c" class="citation">[28c]</a>&nbsp; Why, the
reason you lost four and eightpence last night but one at
Manley&rsquo;s was, because you played bad games: I took notice
of six that you had ten to one against you: Would any but a mad
lady go out twice upon Manilio; Basto, and two small diamonds? <a
name="citation28d"></a><a href="#footnote28d"
class="citation">[28d]</a>&nbsp; Then in that game of spades, you
blundered when you had ten-ace; I never saw the like of you: and
now you are in a huff because I tell you this.&nbsp; Well,
here&rsquo;s two and eightpence halfpenny towards your loss.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Sir Andrew Fountaine came this morning, and caught me
writing in bed.&nbsp; I went into the city with him; and we dined
at the Chop-house with Will Pate, <a name="citation28e"></a><a
href="#footnote28e" class="citation">[28e]</a> the learned
woollen-draper: <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>then we sauntered at China-shops <a
name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a"
class="citation">[29a]</a> and booksellers; went to the tavern,
drank two pints of white wine, and never parted till ten: and now
I am come home, and must copy out some papers I intend for Mr.
Harley, whom I am to see, as I told you, to-morrow afternoon; so
that this night I shall say little to MD, but that I heartily
wish myself with them, and will come as soon as I either fail, or
compass my business.&nbsp; We now hear daily of elections; and,
in a list I saw yesterday of about twenty, there are seven or
eight more Tories than in the last Parliament; so that I believe
they need not fear a majority, with the help of those who will
vote as the Court pleases.&nbsp; But I have been told that Mr.
Harley himself would not let the Tories be too numerous, for fear
they should be insolent, and kick against him; and for that
reason they have kept several Whigs in employments, who expected
to be turned out every day; as Sir John Holland the Comptroller,
and many others.&nbsp; And so get you gone to your cards, and
your claret and orange, at the Dean&rsquo;s; and I&rsquo;ll go
write.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; I wonder when this letter will be finished: it must
go by Tuesday, that&rsquo;s certain; and if I have one from MD
before, I will not answer it, that&rsquo;s as certain too.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis now morning, and I did not finish my papers for Mr.
Harley last night; for you must understand Presto was sleepy, and
made blunders and blots.&nbsp; Very pretty that I must be writing
to young women in a morning fresh and fasting, faith.&nbsp; Well,
good-morrow to you; and so I go to business, and lay aside this
paper till night, sirrahs.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; Jack How <a
name="citation29b"></a><a href="#footnote29b"
class="citation">[29b]</a> told Harley that if there were a lower
place in hell than another, it was reserved for his porter, who
tells lies so gravely, and with so civil a manner.&nbsp; This
porter I have had to deal with, going this evening at four to
visit Mr. Harley, by his own <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>appointment.&nbsp; But the fellow
told me no lie, though I suspected every word he said.&nbsp; He
told me his master was just gone to dinner, with much company,
and desired I would come an hour hence: which I did, expecting to
hear Mr. Harley was gone out; but they had just done
dinner.&nbsp; Mr. Harley came out to me, brought me in, and
presented to me his son-in-law Lord Doblane <a
name="citation30a"></a><a href="#footnote30a"
class="citation">[30a]</a> (or some such name) and his own son,
<a name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a> and, among others, Will Penn <a
name="citation30c"></a><a href="#footnote30c"
class="citation">[30c]</a> the Quaker: we sat two hours drinking
as good wine as you do; and two hours more he and I alone; where
he heard me tell my business; entered into it with all kindness;
asked for my powers, and read them; and read likewise a memorial
<a name="citation30d"></a><a href="#footnote30d"
class="citation">[30d]</a> I had drawn up, and put it in his
pocket to show the Queen; told me the measures he would take;
and, in short, said everything I could wish: told me, he must
bring Mr. St. John <a name="citation30e"></a><a
href="#footnote30e" class="citation">[30e]</a> (Secretary of
State) and me acquainted; and spoke so many things of personal
kindness and esteem for me, that I am inclined half to believe
what some friends have told me, that he would do everything to
bring me over.&nbsp; He has desired to dine with me (what a
comical mistake was that!).&nbsp; I mean he has desired me to
dine with him on Tuesday; and after four hours being with him,
set me down at St. James&rsquo;s Coffee-house in a
hackney-coach.&nbsp; All this is odd and comical, if you consider
him and me.&nbsp; He knew my Christian name very well.&nbsp; I
could not forbear saying thus much upon this matter, although you
will think it tedious.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll tell you; <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>you must
know, &rsquo;tis fatal <a name="citation31a"></a><a
href="#footnote31a" class="citation">[31a]</a> to me to be a
scoundrel and a prince the same day: for, being to see him at
four, I could not engage myself to dine at any friend&rsquo;s; so
I went to Tooke, <a name="citation31b"></a><a href="#footnote31b"
class="citation">[31b]</a> to give him a ballad, and dine with
him; but he was not at home: so I was forced to go to a blind <a
name="citation31c"></a><a href="#footnote31c"
class="citation">[31c]</a> chop-house, and dine for tenpence upon
gill-ale, <a name="citation31d"></a><a href="#footnote31d"
class="citation">[31d]</a> bad broth, and three chops of mutton;
and then go reeking from thence to the First Minister of
State.&nbsp; And now I am going in charity to send Steele a
<i>Tatler</i>, who is very low of late.&nbsp; I think I am
civiller than I used to be; and have not used the expression of
&ldquo;you in Ireland&rdquo; and &ldquo;we in England&rdquo; as I
did when I was here before, to your great indignation.&mdash;They
may talk of the you know what; <a name="citation31e"></a><a
href="#footnote31e" class="citation">[31e]</a> but, gad, if it
had not been for that, I should never have been able to get the
access I have had; and if that helps me to succeed, then that
same thing will be serviceable to the Church.&nbsp; But how far
we must depend upon new friends, I have learnt by long practice,
though I think among great Ministers, they are just as good as
old ones.&nbsp; And so I think this important day has made a
great hole in this side of the paper; and the fiddle-faddles of
to-morrow and Monday will make up the rest; and, besides, I shall
see Harley on Tuesday before this letter goes.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; I must tell you a great piece of refinement <a
name="citation31f"></a><a href="#footnote31f"
class="citation">[31f]</a> of Harley.&nbsp; He charged me to come
to him often: I told him I was loth to trouble him in so much
business as he had, and desired I might have leave to come at his
levee; which he immediately refused, and said, that was not a
place for friends to come to.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis now but morning;
and I have got a foolish trick, I must say something to MD when I
wake, and wish them a good-morrow; for this is not a shaving-day,
Sunday, so I have time enough: but get you gone, you rogues, I
must go write: Yes, &rsquo;twill vex me to the blood if any of
these long letters <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>should miscarry: if they do, I will shrink to
half-sheets again; but then what will you do to make up the
journal? there will be ten days of Presto&rsquo;s life lost; and
that will be a sad thing, faith and troth.&mdash;At night.&nbsp;
I was at a loss to-day for a dinner, unless I would have gone a
great way, so I dined with some friends that board hereabout, <a
name="citation32a"></a><a href="#footnote32a"
class="citation">[32a]</a> as a spunger; <a
name="citation32b"></a><a href="#footnote32b"
class="citation">[32b]</a> and this evening Sir Andrew Fountaine
would needs have me go to the tavern; where, for two bottles of
wine, Portugal and Florence, among three of us, we had sixteen
shillings to pay; but if ever he catches me so again, I&rsquo;ll
spend as many pounds: and therefore I have it among my
extraordinaries but we had a neck of mutton dressed <i>&agrave;
la Maintenon</i>, that the dog could not eat: and it is now
twelve o&rsquo;clock, and I must go sleep.&nbsp; I hope this
letter will go before I have MD&rsquo;s third.&nbsp; Do you
believe me? and yet, faith, I long for MD&rsquo;s third too and
yet I would have it to say, that I writ five for two.&nbsp; I am
not fond at all of St. James&rsquo;s Coffee-house, <a
name="citation32c"></a><a href="#footnote32c"
class="citation">[32c]</a> as I used to be.&nbsp; I hope it will
mend in winter; but now they are all out of town at elections, or
not come from their country houses.&nbsp; Yesterday I was going
with Dr. Garth <a name="citation32d"></a><a href="#footnote32d"
class="citation">[32d]</a> to dine with Charles Main, <a
name="citation32e"></a><a href="#footnote32e"
class="citation">[32e]</a> near the Tower, who has an employment
there: he is of Ireland; the Bishop of Clogher knows him well: an
honest, good-natured fellow, a thorough hearty laugher, mightily
beloved by the men of wit: his mistress is never above a
cook-maid.&nbsp; And so, good-night, etc.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Sir John Stanley&rsquo;s; my Lady
Stanley <a name="citation32f"></a><a href="#footnote32f"
class="citation">[32f]</a> is one of my favourites: I have as
many here as the Bishop of Killala has in Ireland.&nbsp; I am
thinking what scurvy company I shall be to MD when I come back:
they know everything of me already: I will tell you no more, or I
shall have nothing to say, no story to tell, nor any kind of
thing.&nbsp; I was <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>very uneasy last night with ugly, nasty, filthy wine,
that turned sour on my stomach.&nbsp; I must go to the tavern:
oh, but I told you that before.&nbsp; To-morrow I dine at
Harley&rsquo;s, and will finish this letter at my return; but I
can write no more now, because of the Archbishop: faith,
&rsquo;tis true; for I am going now to write to him an account of
what I have done in the business with Harley: <a
name="citation33a"></a><a href="#footnote33a"
class="citation">[33a]</a> and, faith, young women, I&rsquo;ll
tell you what you must count upon, that I never will write one
word on the third side in these long letters.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Poor MD&rsquo;s letter was lying so huddled up among
papers, I could not find it: I mean poor Presto&rsquo;s
letter.&nbsp; Well, I dined with Mr. Harley to-day, and hope some
things will be done; but I must say no more: and this letter must
be sent to the post-house, and not by the bellman. <a
name="citation33b"></a><a href="#footnote33b"
class="citation">[33b]</a>&nbsp; I am to dine again there on
Sunday next; I hope to some good issue.&nbsp; And so now, soon as
ever I can in bed, I must begin my 6th to MD as gravely as if I
had not written a word this month: fine doings, faith!&nbsp;
Methinks I don&rsquo;t write as I should, because I am not in
bed: see the ugly wide lines.&nbsp; God Almighty ever bless you,
etc.</p>
<p>Faith, this is a whole treatise; I&rsquo;ll go reckon the
lines on the other sides.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve reckoned them. <a
name="citation33c"></a><a href="#footnote33c"
class="citation">[33c]</a></p>
<h3>LETTER VI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Oct.</i> 10, 1710.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">So</span>, as I told you just now in the
letter I sent half an hour ago, I dined with Mr. Harley to-day,
who presented me to the Attorney-General, Sir Simon Harcourt,
with much compliment on all sides, etc.&nbsp; Harley told me he
had shown my memorial to the Queen, and seconded it very
heartily; and he desires me to dine with him again on Sunday,
when he promises to settle it with Her Majesty, <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>before she
names a Governor: <a name="citation34a"></a><a
href="#footnote34a" class="citation">[34a]</a> and I protest I am
in hopes it will be done, all but the forms, by that time; for he
loves the Church.&nbsp; This is a popular thing, and he would not
have a Governor share in it; and, besides, I am told by all
hands, he has a mind to gain me over.&nbsp; But in the letter I
writ last post (yesterday) to the Archbishop, I did not tell him
a syllable of what Mr. Harley said to me last night, because he
charged me to keep it secret; so I would not tell it to you, but
that, before this goes, I hope the secret will be over.&nbsp; I
am now writing my poetical &ldquo;Description of a Shower in
London,&rdquo; and will send it to the <i>Tatler</i>. <a
name="citation34b"></a><a href="#footnote34b"
class="citation">[34b]</a>&nbsp; This is the last sheet of a
whole quire I have written since I came to town.&nbsp; Pray, now
it comes into my head, will you, when you go to Mrs. Walls,
contrive to know whether Mrs. Wesley <a name="citation34c"></a><a
href="#footnote34c" class="citation">[34c]</a> be in town, and
still at her brother&rsquo;s, and how she is in health, and
whether she stays in town.&nbsp; I writ to her from Chester, to
know what I should do with her note; and I believe the poor woman
is afraid to write to me: so I must go to my business, etc.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; To-day at last I dined with Lord Mountrath, <a
name="citation34d"></a><a href="#footnote34d"
class="citation">[34d]</a> and carried Lord Mountjoy, and Sir
Andrew Fountaine with me; and was looking over them at ombre till
eleven this evening like a fool: they played running ombre
half-crowns; and Sir Andrew Fountaine won eight guineas of Mr.
Coote; <a name="citation34e"></a><a href="#footnote34e"
class="citation">[34e]</a> so I am come home late, and will say
but little to MD this night.&nbsp; I have gotten half a bushel of
coals, and Patrick, the extravagant whelp, had a fire ready for
me; but I picked off the coals before I went to bed.&nbsp; It is
a sign London is now an empty place, when it will not furnish me
with matter for above five or six lines in a day.&nbsp; Did you
smoke in my last how I told you the very day and the place you
were playing at ombre?&nbsp; But I interlined and altered a
little, after I had <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>received a letter from Mr. Manley, that said you were at
it in his house, while he was writing to me; but without his help
I guessed within one day.&nbsp; Your town is certainly much more
sociable than ours.&nbsp; I have not seen your mother yet,
etc.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Dr. Garth and Mr. Addison, at
the Devil Tavern <a name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a> by Temple Bar, and Garth treated; and
&rsquo;tis well I dine every day, else I should be longer making
out my letters: for we are yet in a very dull state, only
inquiring every day after new elections, where the Tories carry
it among the new members six to one.&nbsp; Mr. Addison&rsquo;s
election <a name="citation35b"></a><a href="#footnote35b"
class="citation">[35b]</a> has passed easy and undisputed; and I
believe if he had a mind to be chosen king, he would hardly be
refused.&nbsp; An odd accident has happened at Colchester: one
Captain Lavallin, <a name="citation35c"></a><a
href="#footnote35c" class="citation">[35c]</a> coming from
Flanders or Spain, found his wife with child by a clerk of
Doctors&rsquo; Commons, whose trade, you know, it is to prevent
fornications: and this clerk was the very same fellow that made
the discovery of Dyot&rsquo;s <a name="citation35d"></a><a
href="#footnote35d" class="citation">[35d]</a> counterfeiting the
stamp-paper.&nbsp; Lavallin has been this fortnight hunting after
the clerk, to kill him; but the fellow was constantly employed at
the Treasury, about the discovery he made: the wife had made a
shift to patch up the business, alleging that the clerk had told
her her husband was dead and other excuses; but t&rsquo;other day
somebody told Lavallin his wife had intrigues before he married
her: upon which he goes down in a rage, shoots his wife through
the head, then falls on his sword; and, to make the matter sure,
at the same time discharges a pistol through his own head, and
died on the spot, his wife surviving him about two hours, but in
what circumstances of mind and body is terrible to imagine.&nbsp;
I have finished my poem on the &ldquo;Shower,&rdquo; all but the
beginning; and am going on with my <i>Tatler</i>.&nbsp; They have
fixed about <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>fifty things on me since I came: I have printed but
three. <a name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a"
class="citation">[36a]</a> One advantage I get by writing to you
daily, or rather you get, is, that I shall remember not to write
the same things twice; and yet, I fear, I have done it often
already: but I will mind and confine myself to the accidents of
the day; and so get you gone to ombre, and be good girls, and
save your money, and be rich against Presto comes, and write to
me now and then: I am thinking it would be a pretty thing to hear
sometimes from saucy MD; but do not hurt your eyes, Stella, I
charge you.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; O Lord, here is but a trifle of my letter written
yet; what shall Presto do for prattle-prattle, to entertain
MD?&nbsp; The talk now grows fresher of the Duke of Ormond for
Ireland; though Mr. Addison says he hears it will be in
commission, and Lord Galway <a name="citation36b"></a><a
href="#footnote36b" class="citation">[36b]</a> one.&nbsp; These
letters of mine are a sort of journal, where matters open by
degrees; and, as I tell true or false, you will find by the event
whether my intelligence be good; but I do not care twopence
whether it be or no.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; To-day I was all about
St. Paul&rsquo;s, and up at the top like a fool, with Sir Andrew
Fountaine and two more; and spent seven shillings for my dinner
like a puppy: this is the second time he has served me so; but I
will never do it again, though all mankind should persuade me,
unconsidering puppies!&nbsp; There is a young fellow here in town
we are all fond of, and about a year or two come from the
University, one Harrison, <a name="citation36c"></a><a
href="#footnote36c" class="citation">[36c]</a> a little pretty
fellow, with a <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>great deal of wit, good sense, and good nature; has
written some mighty pretty things; that in your 6th
<i>Miscellanea</i>, <a name="citation37a"></a><a
href="#footnote37a" class="citation">[37a]</a> about the Sprig of
an Orange, is his: he has nothing to live on but being governor
to one of the Duke of Queensberry&rsquo;s <a
name="citation37b"></a><a href="#footnote37b"
class="citation">[37b]</a> sons for forty pounds a year.&nbsp;
The fine fellows are always inviting him to the tavern, and make
him pay his club.&nbsp; Henley <a name="citation37c"></a><a
href="#footnote37c" class="citation">[37c]</a> is a great crony
of his: they are often at the tavern at six or seven shillings
reckoning, and he always makes the poor lad pay his full
share.&nbsp; A colonel and a lord were at him and me the same way
to-night: I absolutely refused, and made Harrison lag behind, and
persuaded him not to go to them.&nbsp; I tell you this, because I
find all rich fellows have that humour of using all people
without any consideration of their fortunes; but I will see them
rot before they shall serve me so.&nbsp; Lord Halifax is always
teasing me to go down to his country house, which will cost me a
guinea to his servants, and twelve shillings coach-hire; and he
shall be hanged first.&nbsp; Is not this a plaguy silly
story?&nbsp; But I am vexed at the heart; for I love the young
fellow, and am resolved to stir up people to do something for
him: he is a Whig, and I will put him upon some of my cast Whigs;
for I have done with them; and they have, I hope, done with this
kingdom for our time.&nbsp; They were sure of the four members
for London above all places, and they have lost three in the
four. <a name="citation37d"></a><a href="#footnote37d"
class="citation">[37d]</a>&nbsp; Sir Richard Onslow, <a
name="citation37e"></a><a href="#footnote37e"
class="citation">[37e]</a> we hear, has lost <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>for Surrey;
and they are overthrown in most places.&nbsp; Lookee,
gentlewomen, if I write long letters, I must write you news and
stuff, unless I send you my verses; and some I dare not; and
those on the &ldquo;Shower in London&rdquo; I have sent to the
<i>Tatler</i>, and you may see them in Ireland.&nbsp; I fancy you
will smoke me in the <i>Tatler</i> I am going to write; for I
believe I have told you the hint.&nbsp; I had a letter sent me
to-night from Sir Matthew Dudley, and found it on my table when I
came in.&nbsp; Because it is extraordinary, I will transcribe it
from beginning to end.&nbsp; It is as follows: &ldquo;Is the
Devil in you?&nbsp; Oct. 13, 1710.&rdquo;&nbsp; I would have
answered every particular passage in it, only I wanted
time.&nbsp; Here is enough for to-night, such as it is, etc.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; Is that tobacco at the top of the paper, <a
name="citation38a"></a><a href="#footnote38a"
class="citation">[38a]</a> or what?&nbsp; I do not remember I
slobbered.&nbsp; Lord, I dreamt of Stella, etc., so confusedly
last night, and that we saw Dean Bolton <a
name="citation38b"></a><a href="#footnote38b"
class="citation">[38b]</a> and Sterne <a
name="citation38c"></a><a href="#footnote38c"
class="citation">[38c]</a> go into a shop: and she bid me call
them to her, and they proved to be two parsons I know not; and I
walked without till she was shifting, and such stuff, mixed with
much melancholy and uneasiness, and things not as they should be,
and I know not how: and it is now an ugly gloomy
morning.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; Mr. Addison and I dined with Ned
Southwell, and walked in the Park; and at the Coffee-house I
found a letter from the Bishop of Clogher, and a packet from
MD.&nbsp; I opened the Bishop&rsquo;s letter; but put up
MD&rsquo;s, and visited a lady just come to town; and am now got
into bed, and going to open your little letter: and God send I
may find MD well, and happy, and merry, and that they love Presto
as they do fires.&nbsp; Oh, <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>I will not open it yet! yes I will!
no I will not!&nbsp; I am going; I cannot stay till I turn over.
<a name="citation39a"></a><a href="#footnote39a"
class="citation">[39a]</a>&nbsp; What shall I do?&nbsp; My
fingers itch; and now I have it in my left hand; and now I will
open it this very moment.&mdash;I have just got it, and am
cracking the seal, and cannot imagine what is in it; I fear only
some letter from a bishop, and it comes too late; I shall employ
nobody&rsquo;s credit but my own.&nbsp; Well, I see
though&mdash;&nbsp; Pshaw, &rsquo;tis from Sir Andrew
Fountaine.&nbsp; What, another!&nbsp; I fancy that&rsquo;s from
Mrs. Barton; <a name="citation39b"></a><a href="#footnote39b"
class="citation">[39b]</a> she told me she would write to me; but
she writes a better hand than this: I wish you would inquire; it
must be at Dawson&rsquo;s <a name="citation39c"></a><a
href="#footnote39c" class="citation">[39c]</a> office at the
Castle.&nbsp; I fear this is from Patty Rolt, by the
scrawl.&nbsp; Well, I will read MD&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; Ah, no;
it is from poor Lady Berkeley, to invite me to Berkeley Castle
this winter; and now it grieves my heart: she says, she hopes my
lord is in a fair way of recovery; <a name="citation39d"></a><a
href="#footnote39d" class="citation">[39d]</a> poor lady! Well,
now I go to MD&rsquo;s letter: faith, it is all right; I hoped it
was wrong.&nbsp; Your letter, N. 3, that I have now received, is
dated Sept. 26; and Manley&rsquo;s letter, that I had five days
ago, was dated Oct. 3, that&rsquo;s a fortnight difference: I
doubt it has lain in Steele&rsquo;s office, and he forgot.&nbsp;
Well, there&rsquo;s an end of that: he is turned out of his
place; <a name="citation39e"></a><a href="#footnote39e"
class="citation">[39e]</a> and you must desire those who send me
packets, to enclose them in a paper directed to Mr. Addison, at
St. James&rsquo;s Coffee-house: not common letters, but packets:
the Bishop of Clogher may mention it to the Archbishop when he
sees him.&nbsp; As for your letter, it makes me mad: slidikins, I
have been the best boy in Christendom, and you come with your two
eggs a penny.&mdash;Well; but stay, I will look over my book:
adad, I think there was a chasm between my N. 2 and N. 3.&nbsp;
Faith, I will not promise to write to you every week; but I will
write <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>every night, and when it is full I will send it; that
will be once in ten days, and that will be often enough: and if
you begin to take up the way of writing to Presto, only because
it is Tuesday, a Monday bedad it will grow a task; but write when
you have a mind.&mdash;No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no&mdash;Agad,
agad, agad, agad, agad, agad; no, poor Stellakins. <a
name="citation40a"></a><a href="#footnote40a"
class="citation">[40a]</a>&nbsp; Slids, I would the horse were in
your&mdash;chamber!&nbsp; Have not I ordered Parvisol to obey
your directions about him?&nbsp; And han&rsquo;t I said in my
former letters that you may pickle him, and boil him, if you
will?&nbsp; What do you trouble me about your horses for?&nbsp;
Have I anything to do with them?&mdash;Revolutions a hindrance to
me in my business?&nbsp; Revolutions to me in my business?&nbsp;
If it were not for the revolutions, I could do nothing at all;
and now I have all hopes possible, though one is certain of
nothing; but to-morrow I am to have an answer, and am promised an
effectual one.&nbsp; I suppose I have said enough in this and a
former letter how I stand with new people; ten times better than
ever I did with the old; forty times more caressed.&nbsp; I am to
dine to-morrow at Mr. Harley&rsquo;s; and if he continues as he
has begun, no man has been ever better treated by another.&nbsp;
What you say about Stella&rsquo;s mother, I have spoken enough to
it already.&nbsp; I believe she is not in town; for I have not
yet seen her.&nbsp; My lampoon is cried up to the skies; but
nobody suspects me for it, except Sir Andrew Fountaine: at least
they say nothing of it to me.&nbsp; Did not I tell you of a great
man who received me very coldly? <a name="citation40b"></a><a
href="#footnote40b" class="citation">[40b]</a>&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
he; but say nothing; &rsquo;twas only a little revenge.&nbsp; I
will remember to bring it over.&nbsp; The Bishop of Clogher has
smoked my <i>Tatler</i>, <a name="citation40c"></a><a
href="#footnote40c" class="citation">[40c]</a> about shortening
of words, etc.&nbsp; But, God So! <a name="citation40d"></a><a
href="#footnote40d" class="citation">[40d]</a> etc.</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>15.&nbsp; I will write plainer if I can remember it; for
Stella must not spoil her eyes, and Dingley can&rsquo;t read my
hand very well; and I am afraid my letters are too long: then you
must suppose one to be two, and read them at twice.&nbsp; I dined
to-day with Mr. Harley: Mr. Prior <a name="citation41a"></a><a
href="#footnote41a" class="citation">[41a]</a> dined with
us.&nbsp; He has left my memorial with the Queen, who has
consented to give the First-Fruits and Twentieth Parts, <a
name="citation41b"></a><a href="#footnote41b"
class="citation">[41b]</a> and will, we hope, declare it
to-morrow in the Cabinet.&nbsp; But I beg you to tell it to no
person alive; for so I am ordered, till in public: and I hope to
get something of greater value.&nbsp; After dinner came in Lord
Peterborow: <a name="citation41c"></a><a href="#footnote41c"
class="citation">[41c]</a> we renewed our acquaintance, and he
grew mightily fond of me.&nbsp; They began to talk of a paper of
verses called &ldquo;Sid Hamet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Harley repeated
part, and then pulled them out, and gave them to a gentleman at
the table to read, though they had all read them often.&nbsp;
Lord Peterborow would let nobody read them but himself: so he
did; and Mr. Harley bobbed <a name="citation41d"></a><a
href="#footnote41d" class="citation">[41d]</a> me at every line,
to take notice of the beauties.&nbsp; Prior rallied Lord
Peterborow for author of them; and Lord Peterborow said he knew
them to be his; and Prior then turned it upon me, and I on
him.&nbsp; I am not guessed at all in town to be the author; yet
so it is: but that is a secret only to you. <a
name="citation41e"></a><a href="#footnote41e"
class="citation">[41e]</a>&nbsp; Ten to one whether you see them
in Ireland; yet here they run prodigiously.&nbsp; Harley
presented me to Lord President of Scotland, <a
name="citation41f"></a><a href="#footnote41f"
class="citation">[41f]</a> and Mr. Benson, <a
name="citation41g"></a><a href="#footnote41g"
class="citation">[41g]</a> Lord of the Treasury.&nbsp; Prior <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>and I came
away at nine, and sat at the Smyrna <a name="citation42a"></a><a
href="#footnote42a" class="citation">[42a]</a> till eleven,
receiving acquaintance.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; This morning early I went in a chair, and Patrick
before it, to Mr. Harley, to give him another copy of my
memorial, as he desired; but he was full of business, going to
the Queen, and I could not see him; but he desired I would send
up the paper, and excused himself upon his hurry.&nbsp; I was a
little baulked; but they tell me it is nothing.&nbsp; I shall
judge by next visit.&nbsp; I tipped his porter with half a crown;
and so I am well there for a time at least.&nbsp; I dined at
Stratford&rsquo;s in the City, and had Burgundy and Tokay: came
back afoot like a scoundrel: then went with Mr. Addison and
supped with Lord Mountjoy, which made me sick all night.&nbsp; I
forgot that I bought six pounds of chocolate for Stella, and a
little wooden box; and I have a great piece of Brazil tobacco for
Dingley, <a name="citation42b"></a><a href="#footnote42b"
class="citation">[42b]</a> and a bottle of palsy-water <a
name="citation42c"></a><a href="#footnote42c"
class="citation">[42c]</a> for Stella: all which, with the two
handkerchiefs that Mr. Sterne has bought, and you must pay him
for, will be put in the box, directed to Mrs. Curry&rsquo;s, and
sent by Dr. Hawkshaw, <a name="citation42d"></a><a
href="#footnote42d" class="citation">[42d]</a> whom I have not
seen; but Sterne has undertaken it.&nbsp; The chocolate is a
present, madam, for Stella.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t read this, you
little rogue, with your little eyes; but give it to Dingley, pray
now; and I will write as plain as the skies: and let Dingley
write Stella&rsquo;s part, and Stella dictate to her, when she
apprehends her eyes, etc.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; This letter should have gone this post, if I had not
been taken up with business, and two nights being late out; so it
must stay till Thursday.&nbsp; I dined to-day with your Mr. <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Sterne, <a
name="citation43a"></a><a href="#footnote43a"
class="citation">[43a]</a> by invitation, and drank Irish wine;
<a name="citation43b"></a><a href="#footnote43b"
class="citation">[43b]</a> but, before we parted, there came in
the prince of puppies, Colonel Edgworth; <a
name="citation43c"></a><a href="#footnote43c"
class="citation">[43c]</a> so I went away.&nbsp; This day came
out the <i>Tatler</i>, made up wholly of my &ldquo;Shower,&rdquo;
and a preface to it.&nbsp; They say it is the best thing I ever
writ, and I think so too.&nbsp; I suppose the Bishop of Clogher
will show it you.&nbsp; Pray tell me how you like it.&nbsp; Tooke
is going on with my <i>Miscellany</i>. <a
name="citation43d"></a><a href="#footnote43d"
class="citation">[43d]</a>&nbsp; I&rsquo;d give a penny the
letter to the Bishop of Killaloe <a name="citation43e"></a><a
href="#footnote43e" class="citation">[43e]</a> was in it:
&rsquo;twould do him honour.&nbsp; Could not you contrive to say,
you hear they are printing my things together; and that you with
the bookseller had that letter among the rest: but don&rsquo;t
say anything of it as from me.&nbsp; I forget whether it was good
or no; but only having heard it much commended, perhaps it may
deserve it.&nbsp; Well, I have to-morrow to finish this letter
in, and then I will send it next day.&nbsp; I am so vexed that
you should write your third to me, when you had but my second,
and I had written five, which now I hope you have all: and so I
tell you, you are saucy, little, pretty, dear rogues, etc.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; To-day I dined, by invitation, with Stratford and
others, at a young merchant&rsquo;s in the City, with Hermitage
and Tokay, and stayed till nine, and am now come home.&nbsp; And
that dog Patrick is abroad, and drinking, and I cannot I get my
night-gown.&nbsp; I have a mind to turn that puppy away: he has
been drunk ten times in three weeks.&nbsp; But I han&rsquo;t time
to say more; so good-night, etc.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>19.&nbsp; I am come home from dining in the city with
Mr. Addison, at a merchant&rsquo;s; and just now, at the
Coffee-house, we have notice that the Duke of Ormond was this day
declared Lord Lieutenant at Hampton Court, in Council.&nbsp; I
have not seen Mr. Harley since; but hope the affair is done about
First-Fruits.&nbsp; I will see him, if possible, to-morrow
morning; but this goes to-night.&nbsp; I have sent a box to Mr.
Sterne, to send to you by some friend: I have directed it for Mr.
Curry, at his house; so you have warning when it comes, as I hope
it will soon.&nbsp; The handkerchiefs will be put in some
friend&rsquo;s pocket, not to pay custom.&nbsp; And so here ends
my sixth, sent when I had but three of MD&rsquo;s: now I am
beforehand, and will keep so; and God Almighty bless dearest MD,
etc.</p>
<h3>LETTER VII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Oct.</i> 19, 1710.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Faith</span>, I am undone! this paper is
larger than the other, and yet I am condemned to a sheet; but,
since it is MD, I did not value though I were condemned to a
pair.&nbsp; I told you in my letter to-day where I had been, and
how the day passed; and so, etc.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; To-day I went to Mr. Lewis, at the Secretary&rsquo;s
office, to know when I might see Mr. Harley; and by and by comes
up Mr. Harley himself, and appoints me to dine with him
to-morrow.&nbsp; I dined with Mrs. Vanhomrigh, <a
name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a> and went to wait on the two Lady
Butlers; <a name="citation44b"></a><a href="#footnote44b"
class="citation">[44b]</a> but the porter answered they were not
at home: the meaning was, the youngest, Lady Mary, is to be
married to-morrow to Lord Ashburnham, <a
name="citation44c"></a><a href="#footnote44c"
class="citation">[44c]</a> the best match now in England, twelve
thousand pounds a year, and abundance of money.&nbsp; Tell me how
my &ldquo;Shower&rdquo; is <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>liked in Ireland: I never knew
anything pass better here.&nbsp; I spent the evening with Wortley
Montagu <a name="citation45a"></a><a href="#footnote45a"
class="citation">[45a]</a> and Mr. Addison, over a bottle of
Irish wine.&nbsp; Do they know anything in Ireland of my
greatness among the Tories?&nbsp; Everybody reproaches me of it
here; but I value them not.&nbsp; Have you heard of the verses
about the &ldquo;Rod of Sid Hamet&rdquo;?&nbsp; Say nothing of
them for your life.&nbsp; Hardly anybody suspects me for them;
only they think nobody but Prior or I could write them.&nbsp; But
I doubt they have not reached you.&nbsp; There is likewise a
ballad full of puns on the Westminster Election, <a
name="citation45b"></a><a href="#footnote45b"
class="citation">[45b]</a> that cost me half an hour: it runs,
though it be good for nothing.&nbsp; But this is likewise a
secret to all but MD.&nbsp; If you have them not, I will bring
them over.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; I got MD&rsquo;s fourth to-day at the
Coffee-house.&nbsp; God Almighty bless poor, dear Stella, and her
eyes and head!&nbsp; What shall we do to cure them? poor, dear
life!&nbsp; Your disorders are a pull-back for your good
qualities.&nbsp; Would to Heaven I were this minute shaving your
poor, dear head, either here or there!&nbsp; Pray do not write,
nor read this letter, nor anything else; and I will write plainer
for Dingley to read from henceforward, though my pen is apt to
ramble when I think whom I am writing to.&nbsp; I will not answer
your letter until I tell you that I dined this day with Mr.
Harley, who presented me to the Earl of Stirling, <a
name="citation45c"></a><a href="#footnote45c"
class="citation">[45c]</a> a Scotch lord; and in the evening came
in Lord Peterborow.&nbsp; I stayed till nine before Mr. Harley
would let me go, or tell me anything of my affair.&nbsp; He says
the Queen has now granted the First-Fruits and Twentieth Parts;
but he will not give me leave to write to the Archbishop, because
the Queen designs to signify it to the Bishops in Ireland in
form; and to take <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>notice, that it was done upon a memorial from me; which,
Mr. Harley tells me he does to make it look more respectful to
me, etc.; and I am to see him on Tuesday.&nbsp; I know not
whether I told you that, in my memorial which was given to the
Queen, I begged for two thousand pounds a year more, though it
was not in my commission; but that, Mr. Harley says, cannot yet
be done, and that he and I must talk of it further: however, I
have started it, and it may follow in time.&nbsp; Pray say
nothing of the First-Fruits being granted, unless I give leave at
the bottom of this.&nbsp; I believe never anything was compassed
so soon, and purely done by my personal credit with Mr. Harley,
who is so excessively obliging, that I know not what to make of
it, unless to show the rascals of the other party that they used
a man unworthily who had deserved better.&nbsp; The memorial
given to the Queen from me speaks with great plainness of Lord
Wharton.&nbsp; I believe this business is as important to you as
the Convocation disputes from Tisdall. <a
name="citation46"></a><a href="#footnote46"
class="citation">[46]</a>&nbsp; I hope in a month or two all the
forms of settling this matter will be over; and then I shall have
nothing to do here.&nbsp; I will only add one foolish thing more,
because it is just come into my head.&nbsp; When this thing is
made known, tell me impartially whether they give any of the
merit to me, or no; for I am sure I have so much, that I will
never take it upon me.&mdash;Insolent sluts! because I say
Dublin, Ireland, therefore you must say London, England: that is
Stella&rsquo;s malice.&mdash;Well, for that I will not answer
your letter till to-morrow-day, and so and so: I will go write
something else, and it will not be much; for &rsquo;tis late.</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>22.&nbsp; I was this morning with Mr. Lewis, the
under-secretary to Lord Dartmouth, two hours, talking politics,
and contriving to keep Steele in his office of stamped paper: he
has lost his place of Gazetteer, three hundred pounds a year, for
writing a <i>Tatler</i>, <a name="citation47a"></a><a
href="#footnote47a" class="citation">[47a]</a> some months ago,
against Mr. Harley, who gave it him at first, and raised the
salary from sixty to three hundred pounds.&nbsp; This was
devilish ungrateful; and Lewis was telling me the particulars:
but I had a hint given me, that I might save him in the other
employment: and leave was given me to clear matters with
Steele.&nbsp; Well, I dined with Sir Matthew Dudley, and in the
evening went to sit with Mr. Addison, and offer the matter at
distance to him, as the discreeter person; but found party had so
possessed him, that he talked as if he suspected me, and would
not fall in with anything I said.&nbsp; So I stopped short in my
overture, and we parted very drily; and I shall say nothing to
Steele, and let them do as they will; but, if things stand as
they are, he will certainly lose it, unless I save him; and
therefore I will not speak to him, that I may not report to his
disadvantage.&nbsp; Is not this vexatious? and is there so much
in the proverb of proffered service?&nbsp; When shall I grow
wise?&nbsp; I endeavour to act in the most exact points of honour
and conscience; and my nearest friends will not understand it
so.&nbsp; What must a man expect from his enemies?&nbsp; This
would vex me, but it shall not; and so I bid you good-night,
etc.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; I know &rsquo;tis neither wit nor diversion to tell
you every day where I dine; neither do I write it to fill my
letter; but I fancy I shall, some time or other, have the
curiosity of seeing some particulars how I passed my life when I
was absent from MD this time; and so I tell you now that I dined
to-day at Molesworth&rsquo;s, the Florence Envoy, then went to
the Coffee-house, where I behaved myself coldly enough to Mr.
Addison, and so came home to scribble.&nbsp; We dine together
to-morrow and next day by invitation; but I shall <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>alter my
behaviour to him, till he begs my pardon, or else we shall grow
bare acquaintance.&nbsp; I am weary of friends; and friendships
are all monsters, but MD&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; I forgot to tell you, that last night I went to Mr.
Harley&rsquo;s, hoping&mdash;faith, I am blundering, for it was
this very night at six; and I hoped he would have told me all
things were done and granted: but he was abroad, and came home
ill, and was gone to bed, much out of order, unless the porter
lied.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Sir Matthew Dudley&rsquo;s, with
Mr. Addison, etc.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; I was to-day to see the Duke of Ormond; and, coming
out, met Lord Berkeley of Stratton, <a name="citation48a"></a><a
href="#footnote48a" class="citation">[48a]</a> who told me that
Mrs. Temple, <a name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a> the widow, died last Saturday, which,
I suppose, is much to the outward grief and inward joy of the
family.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Addison and Steele, and a
sister of Mr. Addison, who is married to one Mons. Sartre, <a
name="citation48c"></a><a href="#footnote48c"
class="citation">[48c]</a> a Frenchman, prebendary of
Westminster, who has a delicious house and garden; yet I thought
it was a sort of monastic life in those cloisters, and I liked
Laracor better.&nbsp; Addison&rsquo;s sister is a sort of a wit,
very like him.&nbsp; I am not fond of her, etc.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; I was to-day to see Mr. Congreve, <a
name="citation48d"></a><a href="#footnote48d"
class="citation">[48d]</a> who is almost blind with cataracts
growing on his eyes; and his case is, that he must wait two or
three years, until the cataracts are riper, and till he is quite
blind, and then he must have them couched; and, besides, he is
never rid of the gout, yet he looks young and fresh, and is as
cheerful as ever.&nbsp; He is younger by three years or more than
I; and I am twenty <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>years younger than he.&nbsp; He gave me a pain in the
great toe, by mentioning the gout.&nbsp; I find such suspicions
frequently, but they go off again.&nbsp; I had a second letter
from Mr. Morgan, <a name="citation49a"></a><a href="#footnote49a"
class="citation">[49a]</a> for which I thank you: I wish you were
whipped, for forgetting to send him that answer I desired you in
one of my former, that I could do nothing for him of what he
desired, having no credit at all, etc.&nbsp; Go, be far enough,
you negligent baggages.&nbsp; I have had also a letter from
Parvisol, with an account how my livings are set; and that they
are fallen, since last year, sixty pounds.&nbsp; A comfortable
piece of news!&nbsp; He tells me plainly that he finds you have
no mind to part with the horse, because you sent for him at the
same time you sent him my letter; so that I know not what must be
done.&nbsp; It is a sad thing that Stella must have her own
horse, whether Parvisol will or no.&nbsp; So now to answer your
letter that I had three or four days ago.&nbsp; I am not now in
bed, but am come home by eight; and, it being warm, I write
up.&nbsp; I never writ to the Bishop of Killala, which, I
suppose, was the reason he had not my letter.&nbsp; I have not
time, there is the short of it.&mdash;As fond as the Dean <a
name="citation49b"></a><a href="#footnote49b"
class="citation">[49b]</a> is of my letter, he has not written to
me.&nbsp; I would only know whether Dean Bolton <a
name="citation49c"></a><a href="#footnote49c"
class="citation">[49c]</a> paid him the twenty pounds; and for
the rest, he may kiss&mdash;And that you may ask him, because I
am in pain about it, that Dean Bolton is such a whipster.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis the most obliging thing in the world in Dean Sterne to
be so kind to you.&nbsp; I believe he knows it will please me,
and makes up, that way, his other usage. <a
name="citation49d"></a><a href="#footnote49d"
class="citation">[49d]</a>&nbsp; No, we have had none of your
snow, but a little one morning; yet I think it was great snow for
an hour or so, but no longer.&nbsp; I had heard of Will
Crowe&rsquo;s <a name="citation49e"></a><a href="#footnote49e"
class="citation">[49e]</a> death before, but not the foolish
circumstance that hastened his end.&nbsp; No, I have taken care
that <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>Captain Pratt <a name="citation50a"></a><a
href="#footnote50a" class="citation">[50a]</a> shall not suffer
by Lord Anglesea&rsquo;s death. <a name="citation50b"></a><a
href="#footnote50b" class="citation">[50b]</a>&nbsp; I will try
some contrivance to get a copy of my picture from Jervas.&nbsp; I
will make Sir Andrew Fountaine buy one as for himself, and I will
pay him again, and take it, that is, provided I have money to
spare when I leave this.&mdash;Poor John! is he gone? and Madam
Parvisol <a name="citation50c"></a><a href="#footnote50c"
class="citation">[50c]</a> has been in town! Humm.&nbsp; Why,
Tighe <a name="citation50d"></a><a href="#footnote50d"
class="citation">[50d]</a> and I, when he comes, shall not take
any notice of each other; I would not do it much in this town,
though we had not fallen out.&mdash;I was to-day at Mr.
Sterne&rsquo;s lodging: he was not within; and Mr. Leigh is not
come to town; but I will do Dingley&rsquo;s errand when I see
him.&nbsp; What do I know whether china be dear or no?&nbsp; I
once took a fancy of resolving to grow mad for it, but now it is
off; I suppose I told you in some former letter.&nbsp; And so you
only want some salad-dishes, and plates, and etc.&nbsp; Yes, yes,
you shall.&nbsp; I suppose you have named as much as will cost
five pounds.&mdash;Now to Stella&rsquo;s little postscript; and I
am almost crazed that you vex yourself for not writing.&nbsp;
Cannot you dictate to Dingley, and not strain your little, dear
eyes?&nbsp; I am sure it is the grief of my soul to think you are
out of order.&nbsp; Pray be quiet; and, if you will write, shut
your eyes, and write just a line, and no more, thus, &ldquo;How
do you do, Mrs. Stella?&rdquo;&nbsp; That was written with my
eyes shut.&nbsp; Faith, I think it is better than when they are
open: and then Dingley may stand by, and tell you when you go too
high or too low.&mdash;My letters of business, with packets, if
there be any more occasion for such, must be enclosed to Mr.
Addison, at St. James&rsquo;s Coffee-house: but I hope to hear,
as soon as I see Mr. Harley, that the main difficulties are over,
and that the rest will be but form.&mdash;Take two or three
nutgalls, take two or three&mdash;galls, stop your receipt in
your&mdash;I have no need on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Here is a
clutter!&nbsp; Well, so much for your letter, which I will now
put up in my letter-partition in my cabinet, as I always do every
letter as soon as I answer it.&nbsp; Method <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>is good in
all things.&nbsp; Order governs the world.&nbsp; The Devil is the
author of confusion.&nbsp; A general of an army, a minister of
state; to descend lower, a gardener, a weaver, etc.&nbsp; That
may make a fine observation, if you think it worth finishing; but
I have not time.&nbsp; Is not this a terrible long piece for one
evening?&nbsp; I dined to-day with Patty Rolt at my cousin
Leach&rsquo;s, <a name="citation51a"></a><a href="#footnote51a"
class="citation">[51a]</a> with a pox, in the City: he is a
printer, and prints the <i>Postman</i>, oh hoo, and is my cousin,
God knows how, and he married Mrs. Baby Aires of Leicester; and
my cousin Thomson was with us: and my cousin Leach offers to
bring me acquainted with the author of the <i>Postman</i>; <a
name="citation51b"></a><a href="#footnote51b"
class="citation">[51b]</a> and says he does not doubt but the
gentleman will be glad of my acquaintance; and that he is a very
ingenious man, and a great scholar, and has been beyond
sea.&nbsp; But I was modest and said, may be the gentleman was
shy, and not fond of new acquaintance; and so put it off: and I
wish you could hear me repeating all I have said of this in its
proper tone, just as I am writing it.&nbsp; It is all with the
same cadence with &ldquo;Oh hoo,&rdquo; or as when little girls
say, &ldquo;I have got an apple, miss, and I won&rsquo;t give you
some.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is plaguy twelvepenny weather this last
week, and has cost me ten shillings in coach and chair
hire.&nbsp; If the fellow that has your money will pay it, let me
beg you to buy Bank Stock with it, which is fallen near thirty
per cent. and pays eight pounds per cent. and you have the
principal when you please: it will certainly soon rise.&nbsp; I
would to God Lady Giffard would put in the four hundred pounds
she owes you, <a name="citation51c"></a><a href="#footnote51c"
class="citation">[51c]</a> and take the five per cent. common
interest, and give you the remainder.&nbsp; I will speak to your
mother about it when I see her.&nbsp; I am resolved <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>to buy three
hundred pounds of it for myself, and take up what I have in
Ireland; and I have a contrivance for it, that I hope will do, by
making a friend of mine buy it as for himself, and I will pay him
when I can get in my money.&nbsp; I hope Stratford will do me
that kindness.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll ask him to-morrow or next
day.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; Mr. Rowe <a name="citation52a"></a><a
href="#footnote52a" class="citation">[52a]</a> the poet desired
me to dine with him to-day.&nbsp; I went to his office (he is
under-secretary in Mr. Addison&rsquo;s place that he had in
England), and there was Mr. Prior; and they both fell commending
my &ldquo;Shower&rdquo; beyond anything that has been written of
the kind: there never was such a &ldquo;Shower&rdquo; since
Danae&rsquo;s, etc.&nbsp; You must tell me how it is liked among
you.&nbsp; I dined with Rowe; Prior could not come: and after
dinner we went to a blind tavern, <a name="citation52b"></a><a
href="#footnote52b" class="citation">[52b]</a> where Congreve,
Sir Richard Temple, <a name="citation52c"></a><a
href="#footnote52c" class="citation">[52c]</a> Estcourt, <a
name="citation52d"></a><a href="#footnote52d"
class="citation">[52d]</a> and Charles Main, <a
name="citation52e"></a><a href="#footnote52e"
class="citation">[52e]</a> were over a bowl of bad punch.&nbsp;
The knight sent for six flasks of his own wine for me, and we
stayed till twelve.&nbsp; But now my head continues pretty well;
I have left off my drinking, and only take a spoonful mixed with
water, for fear of the gout, or some ugly distemper; and now,
because it is late, I will, etc.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; Garth and Addison and I dined to-day at a hedge <a
name="citation52f"></a><a href="#footnote52f"
class="citation">[52f]</a> tavern; then I went to Mr. Harley, but
he was denied, or not at home: so I fear I shall not hear my
business is done before this goes.&nbsp; Then I visited Lord
Pembroke, <a name="citation52g"></a><a href="#footnote52g"
class="citation">[52g]</a> who is just come <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>to town; and
we were very merry talking of old things; and I hit him with one
pun.&nbsp; Then I went to see the Ladies Butler, and the son of a
whore of a porter denied them: so I sent them a threatening
message by another lady, for not excepting me always to the
porter.&nbsp; I was weary of the Coffee-house, and Ford <a
name="citation53a"></a><a href="#footnote53a"
class="citation">[53a]</a> desired me to sit with him at next
door; which I did, like a fool, chatting till twelve, and now am
got into bed.&nbsp; I am afraid the new Ministry is at a terrible
loss about money: the Whigs talk so, it would give one the
spleen; and I am afraid of meeting Mr. Harley out of
humour.&nbsp; They think he will never carry through this
undertaking.&nbsp; God knows what will come of it.&nbsp; I should
be terribly vexed to see things come round again: it will ruin
the Church and clergy for ever; but I hope for better.&nbsp; I
will send this on Tuesday, whether I hear any further news of my
affair or not.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; Mr. Addison and I dined to-day with Lord Mountjoy;
which is all the adventures of this day.&mdash;I chatted a while
to-night in the Coffee-house, this being a full night; and now am
come home, to write some business.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Mrs. Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s, and sent
a letter to poor Mrs. Long, <a name="citation53b"></a><a
href="#footnote53b" class="citation">[53b]</a> who writes to us,
but is God knows where, and will not tell anybody the place of
her residence.&nbsp; I came home early, and must go write.</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; The month ends with a fine day; and I have been
walking, and visiting Lewis, and concerting where to see Mr.
Harley.&nbsp; I have no news to send you.&nbsp; Aire, <a
name="citation53c"></a><a href="#footnote53c"
class="citation">[53c]</a> they say, is taken, though the
Whitehall letters this morning say quite the contrary: &rsquo;tis
good, if it be true.&nbsp; I dined with Mr. Addison and Dick
Stewart, Lord Mountjoy&rsquo;s brother; <a
name="citation53d"></a><a href="#footnote53d"
class="citation">[53d]</a> a treat of Addison&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They
were half-fuddled, but not I; for I mixed water with my wine, and
left them together <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>between nine and ten; and I must send this by the
bellman, which vexes me, but I will put it off no longer.&nbsp;
Pray God it does not miscarry.&nbsp; I seldom do so; but I can
put off little MD no longer.&nbsp; Pray give the under note to
Mrs. Brent.</p>
<p>I am a pretty gentleman; and you lose all your money at cards,
sirrah Stella.&nbsp; I found you out; I did so.</p>
<p>I am staying before I can fold up this letter, till that ugly
D is dry in the last line but one.&nbsp; Do not you see it?&nbsp;
O Lord, I am loth to leave you, faith&mdash;but it must be so,
till the next time.&nbsp; Pox take that D; I will blot it, to dry
it.</p>
<h3>LETTER VIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Oct.</i> 31, 1710.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">So</span>, now I have sent my seventh to
your fourth, young women; and now I will tell you what I would
not in my last, that this morning, sitting in my bed, I had a fit
of giddiness: the room turned round for about a minute, and then
it went off, leaving me sickish, but not very: and so I passed
the day as I told you; but I would not end a letter with telling
you this, because it might vex you: and I hope in God I shall
have no more of it.&nbsp; I saw Dr. Cockburn <a
name="citation54a"></a><a href="#footnote54a"
class="citation">[54a]</a> to-day, and he promises to send me the
pills that did me good last year; and likewise has promised me an
oil for my ear, that he has been making for that ailment for
somebody else.</p>
<p>Nov. 1.&nbsp; I wish MD a merry new year.&nbsp; You know this
is the first day of it with us. <a name="citation54b"></a><a
href="#footnote54b" class="citation">[54b]</a>&nbsp; I had no
giddiness to-day; but I drank brandy, and have bought a pint for
two shillings.&nbsp; I sat up the night before my giddiness
pretty late, and writ very much; so I will impute it to
that.&nbsp; But I never eat fruit, nor drink ale; but drink
better wine than you do, as I <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>did to-day with Mr. Addison at Lord
Mountjoy&rsquo;s: then went at five to see Mr. Harley, who could
not see me for much company; but sent me his excuse, and desired
I would dine with him on Friday; and then I expect some answer to
this business, which must either be soon done, or begun again;
and then the Duke of Ormond and his people will interfere for
their honour, and do nothing.&nbsp; I came home at six, and spent
my time in my chamber, without going to the Coffee-house, which I
grow weary of; and I studied at leisure, writ not above forty
lines, some inventions of my own, and some hints, and read not at
all, and this because I would take care of Presto, for fear
little MD should be angry.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I took my four pills last night, and they lay an hour
in my throat, and so they will do to-night.&nbsp; I suppose I
could swallow four affronts as easily.&nbsp; I dined with Dr.
Cockburn to-day, and came home at seven; but Mr. Ford has been
with me till just now, and it is near eleven.&nbsp; I have had no
giddiness to-day.&nbsp; Mr. Dopping <a name="citation55a"></a><a
href="#footnote55a" class="citation">[55a]</a> I have seen; and
he tells me coldly, my &ldquo;Shower&rdquo; is liked well enough;
there&rsquo;s your Irish judgment!&nbsp; I writ this post to the
Bishop of Clogher.&nbsp; It is now just a fortnight since I heard
from you.&nbsp; I must have you write once a fortnight, and then
I will allow for wind and weather.&nbsp; How goes ombre?&nbsp;
Does Mrs. Walls <a name="citation55b"></a><a href="#footnote55b"
class="citation">[55b]</a> win constantly, as she used to
do?&nbsp; And Mrs. Stoyte; <a name="citation55c"></a><a
href="#footnote55c" class="citation">[55c]</a> I have not thought
of her this long time: how does she?&nbsp; I find we have a cargo
of Irish coming for London: I am sorry for it; but I never go
near them.&nbsp; And Tighe is landed; but Mrs. Wesley, <a
name="citation55d"></a><a href="#footnote55d"
class="citation">[55d]</a> they say, is going home to her
husband, like a fool.&nbsp; Well, little monkeys mine, I must go
write; and so good-night.</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>3.&nbsp; I ought to read these letters I write, after I
have done; for, looking over thus much, I found two or three
literal mistakes, which should not be when the hand is so
bad.&nbsp; But I hope it does not puzzle little Dingley to read,
for I think I mend: but methinks, when I write plain, I do not
know how, but we are not alone, all the world can see us.&nbsp; A
bad scrawl is so snug, it looks like a PMD. <a
name="citation56a"></a><a href="#footnote56a"
class="citation">[56a]</a>&nbsp; We have scurvy <i>Tatlers</i> of
late: so pray do not suspect me.&nbsp; I have one or two hints I
design to send him, and never any more: he does not deserve
it.&nbsp; He is governed by his wife most abominably, <a
name="citation56b"></a><a href="#footnote56b"
class="citation">[56b]</a> as bad as &mdash;.&nbsp; I never saw
her since I came; nor has he ever made me an invitation: either
he dares not, or is such a thoughtless Tisdall <a
name="citation56c"></a><a href="#footnote56c"
class="citation">[56c]</a> fellow, that he never minds <a
name="citation56d"></a><a href="#footnote56d"
class="citation">[56d]</a> it.&nbsp; So what care I for his wit?
for he is the worst company in the world, till he has a bottle of
wine in his head.&nbsp; I cannot write straighter in bed, so you
must be content.&mdash;At night in bed.&nbsp; Stay, let me see
where&rsquo;s this letter to MD among these papers?&nbsp; Oh!
here.&nbsp; Well, I will go on now; but I am very busy (smoke the
new pen.)&nbsp; I dined with Mr. Harley to-day, and am invited
there again on Sunday.&nbsp; I have now leave to write to the
Primate and Archbishop of Dublin, that the Queen has granted the
First-Fruits; but they are to take no notice of it, till a letter
is sent them by the Queen&rsquo;s orders from Lord Dartmouth,
Secretary of State, to signify it.&nbsp; The bishops are to be
made a corporation, to dispose of the revenue, etc.; and I shall
write to the Archbishop of Dublin to-morrow (I have had no
giddiness to-day).&nbsp; I know not whether they will have any
occasion for me longer to be here; nor can I judge till I see
what letter the Queen sends to the bishops, and what they will do
upon it.&nbsp; If despatch <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>be used, it may be done in six weeks;
but I cannot judge.&nbsp; They sent me to-day a new Commission,
signed by the Primate and Archbishop of Dublin, <a
name="citation57a"></a><a href="#footnote57a"
class="citation">[57a]</a> and promise me letters to the two
archbishops here; but mine a &mdash; for it all.&nbsp; The thing
is done, and has been so these ten days; though I had only leave
to tell it to-day.&nbsp; I had this day likewise a letter from
the Bishop of Clogher, who complains of my not writing; and, what
vexes me, says he knows you have long letters from me every
week.&nbsp; Why do you tell him so?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not right,
faith: but I won&rsquo;t be angry with MD at distance.&nbsp; I
writ to him last post, before I had his; and will write again
soon, since I see he expects it, and that Lord and Lady Mountjoy
<a name="citation57b"></a><a href="#footnote57b"
class="citation">[57b]</a> put him off upon me, to give
themselves ease.&nbsp; Lastly, I had this day a letter from a
certain naughty rogue called MD, and it was N. 5; which I shall
not answer to-night, I thank you.&nbsp; No, faith, I have other
fish to fry; but to-morrow or next day will be time enough.&nbsp;
I have put MD&rsquo;s commissions in a memorandum paper.&nbsp; I
think I have done all before, and remember nothing but this
to-day about glasses and spectacles and spectacle cases.&nbsp; I
have no commission from Stella, but the chocolate and
handkerchiefs; and those are bought, and I expect they will be
soon sent.&nbsp; I have been with, and sent to, Mr. Sterne, two
or three times to know; but he was not within.&nbsp; Odds my
life, what am I doing?&nbsp; I must go write and do business.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Kensington, with Addison, Steele,
etc., came home, and writ a short letter to the Archbishop of
Dublin, to let him know the Queen has granted the thing,
etc.&nbsp; I writ in the Coffee-house, for I stayed at Kensington
till <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>nine,
and am plaguy weary; for Colonel Proud <a
name="citation58a"></a><a href="#footnote58a"
class="citation">[58a]</a> was very ill company, and I will never
be of a party with him again; and I drank punch, and that and ill
company has made me hot.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I was with Mr. Harley from dinner to seven this
night, and went to the Coffee-house, where Dr. Davenant <a
name="citation58b"></a><a href="#footnote58b"
class="citation">[58b]</a> would fain have had me gone and drink
a bottle of wine at his house hard by, with Dr. Chamberlen, <a
name="citation58c"></a><a href="#footnote58c"
class="citation">[58c]</a> but the puppy used so many words, that
I was afraid of his company; and though we promised to come at
eight, I sent a messenger to him, that Chamberlen was going to a
patient, and therefore we would put it off till another time: so
he, and the Comptroller, <a name="citation58d"></a><a
href="#footnote58d" class="citation">[58d]</a> <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>and I, were
prevailed on by Sir Matthew Dudley to go to his house, where I
stayed till twelve, and left them.&nbsp; Davenant has been
teasing me to look over some of his writings that he is going to
publish; but the rogue is so fond of his own productions, that I
hear he will not part with a syllable; and he has lately put out
a foolish pamphlet, called <i>The Third Part of Tom Double</i>;
to make his court to the Tories, whom he had left.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I was to-day gambling <a name="citation59a"></a><a
href="#footnote59a" class="citation">[59a]</a> in the City to see
Patty Rolt, who is going to Kingston, where she lodges; but, to
say the truth, I had a mind for a walk to exercise myself, and
happened to be disengaged: for dinners are ten times more
plentiful with me here than ever, or than in Dublin.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t answer your letter yet, because I am busy.&nbsp; I
hope to send this before I have another from MD: it would be a
sad thing to answer two letters together, as MD does from
Presto.&nbsp; But when the two sides are full, away the letter
shall go, that is certain, like it or not like it; and that will
be about three days hence, for the answering-night will be a long
one.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Sir Richard Temple&rsquo;s, with
Congreve, Vanbrugh, Lieutenant-General Farrington, <a
name="citation59b"></a><a href="#footnote59b"
class="citation">[59b]</a> etc.&nbsp; Vanbrugh, I believe I told
you, had a long quarrel with me about those verses on his house;
<a name="citation59c"></a><a href="#footnote59c"
class="citation">[59c]</a> but we were very civil and cold.&nbsp;
Lady Marlborough used to tease him with them, which had made him
angry, though he be a good-natured fellow.&nbsp; It was a
Thanksgiving-day, <a name="citation59d"></a><a
href="#footnote59d" class="citation">[59d]</a> and I was at
Court, where the Queen passed us by with all Tories about her;
not one Whig: <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>Buckingham, <a name="citation60a"></a><a
href="#footnote60a" class="citation">[60a]</a> Rochester, <a
name="citation60b"></a><a href="#footnote60b"
class="citation">[60b]</a> Leeds, <a name="citation60c"></a><a
href="#footnote60c" class="citation">[60c]</a> Shrewsbury, <a
name="citation60d"></a><a href="#footnote60d"
class="citation">[60d]</a> Berkeley of Stratton, <a
name="citation60e"></a><a href="#footnote60e"
class="citation">[60e]</a> Lord Keeper Harcourt, <a
name="citation60f"></a><a href="#footnote60f"
class="citation">[60f]</a> Mr. Harley, Lord Pembroke, <a
name="citation60g"></a><a href="#footnote60g"
class="citation">[60g]</a> etc.; and I have seen her without one
Tory.&nbsp; The Queen made me a curtsey, and said, in a sort of
familiar way to Presto, &ldquo;How does MD?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
considered she was a Queen, and so excused her. <a
name="citation60h"></a><a href="#footnote60h"
class="citation">[60h]</a>&nbsp; I do not miss the Whigs at
Court; but have as many acquaintance there as formerly.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s ado and a clutter!&nbsp; I must now
answer MD&rsquo;s fifth; but first you must know I dined at the
Portugal Envoy&rsquo;s <a name="citation60i"></a><a
href="#footnote60i" class="citation">[60i]</a> to-day, with
Addison, Vanbrugh, Admiral Wager, <a name="citation60j"></a><a
href="#footnote60j" class="citation">[60j]</a> Sir Richard
Temple, <a name="citation60k"></a><a href="#footnote60k"
class="citation">[60k]</a> Methuen, <a name="citation60l"></a><a
href="#footnote60l" class="citation">[60l]</a> etc.&nbsp; I was
weary of their company, and stole away at five, and came home
like a good boy, and studied till ten, and had a fire, O ho! and
now am in bed.&nbsp; I have no fireplace in my bed-chamber; but
&rsquo;tis very warm weather when one&rsquo;s in bed.&nbsp; Your
fine cap, <a name="citation60m"></a><a href="#footnote60m"
class="citation">[60m]</a> Madam Dingley, is too little, and too
hot: I will have <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>that fur taken off; I wish it were far enough; and my
old velvet cap is good for nothing.&nbsp; Is it velvet under the
fur?&nbsp; I was feeling, but cannot find: if it be, &rsquo;twill
do without it else I will face it; but then I must buy new
velvet: but may be I may beg a piece.&nbsp; What shall I
do?&nbsp; Well, now to rogue MD&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; God be
thanked for Stella&rsquo;s eyes mending; and God send it holds;
but faith you writ too much at a time: better write less, or
write it at ten times.&nbsp; Yes, faith, a long letter in a
morning from a dear friend is a dear thing.&nbsp; I smoke a
compliment, little mischievous girls, I do so.&nbsp; But who are
those <i>Wiggs</i> that think I am turned Tory?&nbsp; Do you mean
Whigs?&nbsp; Which <i>Wiggs</i> and <i>wat</i> do you mean?&nbsp;
I know nothing of Raymond, and only had one letter from him a
little after I came here. [Pray remember Morgan.]&nbsp; Raymond
is indeed like to have much influence over me in London, and to
share much of my conversation.&nbsp; I shall, no doubt, introduce
him to Harley, and Lord Keeper, and the Secretary of State.&nbsp;
The <i>Tatler</i> upon Ithuriel&rsquo;s spear <a
name="citation61a"></a><a href="#footnote61a"
class="citation">[61a]</a> is not mine, madam.&nbsp; What a
puzzle there is betwixt you and your judgment!&nbsp; In general
you may be sometimes sure of things, as that about <i>style</i>,
<a name="citation61b"></a><a href="#footnote61b"
class="citation">[61b]</a> because it is what I have frequently
spoken of; but guessing is mine a&mdash;, and I defy mankind, if
I please.&nbsp; Why, I writ a pamphlet when I was last in London,
that you and a thousand have seen, and never guessed it to be
mine.&nbsp; Could you have guessed the &ldquo;Shower in
Town&rdquo; to be mine?&nbsp; How chance you did not see that
before your last letter went? but I suppose you in Ireland did
not think it worth mentioning.&nbsp; Nor am I suspected for the
lampoon; only Harley said he smoked me; (have I told you so
before?) and some others knew it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis called
&ldquo;The Rod of Sid Hamet.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I have written
several other things that I hear commended, and nobody suspects
me for them; nor you shall not know till I see you again.&nbsp;
What do you mean, &ldquo;That <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>boards near me, that I dine with now
and then?&rdquo;&nbsp; I know no such person: I do not dine with
boarders. <a name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a"
class="citation">[62a]</a>&nbsp; What the pox!&nbsp; You know
whom I have dined with every day since I left you, better than I
do.&nbsp; What do you mean, sirrah?&nbsp; Slids, my ailment has
been over these two months almost.&nbsp; Impudence, if you vex
me, I will give ten shillings a week for my lodging; for I am
almost st&mdash;k out of this with the sink, and it helps me to
verses in my &ldquo;Shower.&rdquo; <a name="citation62b"></a><a
href="#footnote62b" class="citation">[62b]</a>&nbsp; Well, Madam
Dingley, what say you to the world to come?&nbsp; What
ballad?&nbsp; Why go look, it was not good for much: have
patience till I come back: patience is a gay thing as, etc.&nbsp;
I hear nothing of Lord Mountjoy&rsquo;s coming for Ireland.&nbsp;
When is Stella&rsquo;s birthday? in March?&nbsp; Lord bless me,
my turn at Christ Church; <a name="citation62c"></a><a
href="#footnote62c" class="citation">[62c]</a> it is so natural
to hear you write about that, I believe you have done it a
hundred times; it is as fresh in my mind, the verger coming to
you; and why to you?&nbsp; Would he have you preach for me?&nbsp;
O, pox on your spelling of Latin, <i>Johnsonibus atque</i>, that
is the way.&nbsp; How did the Dean get that name by the
end?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas you betrayed me: not I, faith; I&rsquo;ll
not break his head.&nbsp; Your mother is still in the country, I
suppose; for she promised to see me when she came to town.&nbsp;
I writ to her four days ago, to desire her to break it to Lady
Giffard, to put some money for you in the Bank, which was then
fallen thirty per cent.&nbsp; Would to God mine had been here, I
should have gained one hundred pounds, and got as good interest
as in Ireland, and much securer.&nbsp; I would fain have borrowed
three hundred pounds; but money is so scarce here, there is no
borrowing, by this fall of stocks.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis rising now,
and I knew it would: it fell from one hundred and twenty-nine to
ninety-six.&nbsp; I have not heard since from your mother.&nbsp;
Do you think I would be so unkind not to see her, that you desire
me in a style so <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>melancholy?&nbsp; Mrs. Raymond, <a
name="citation63a"></a><a href="#footnote63a"
class="citation">[63a]</a> you say, is with child: I am sorry for
it; and so is, I believe, her husband.&nbsp; Mr. Harley speaks
all the kind things to me in the world; and, I believe, would
serve me, if I were to stay here; but I reckon in time the Duke
of Ormond may give me some addition to Laracor.&nbsp; Why should
the Whigs think I came to England to leave them?&nbsp; Sure my
journey was no secret.&nbsp; I protest sincerely, I did all I
could to hinder it, as the Dean can tell you, although now I do
not repent it.&nbsp; But who the Devil cares what they
think?&nbsp; Am I under obligations in the least to any of them
all?&nbsp; Rot &rsquo;em, for ungrateful dogs; I will make them
repent their usage before I leave this place.&nbsp; They say here
the same thing of my leaving the Whigs; but they own they cannot
blame me, considering the treatment I have had.&nbsp; I will take
care of your spectacles, as I told you before, and of the Bishop
of Killala&rsquo;s; but I will not write to him, I have not
time.&nbsp; What do you mean by my fourth, Madam Dinglibus?&nbsp;
Does not Stella say you have had my fifth, Goody Blunder?&nbsp;
You frighted me till I looked back.&nbsp; Well, this is enough
for one night.&nbsp; Pray give my humble service to Mrs. Stoyte
and her sister, Kate is it, or Sarah? <a
name="citation63b"></a><a href="#footnote63b"
class="citation">[63b]</a>&nbsp; I have forgot her name,
faith.&nbsp; I think I will even (and to Mrs. Walls and the
Archdeacon) send this to-morrow: no, faith, that will be in ten
days from the last.&nbsp; I will keep it till Saturday, though I
write no more.&nbsp; But what if a letter from MD should come in
the meantime?&nbsp; Why then I would only say, &ldquo;Madam, I
have received your sixth letter; your most humble servant to
command, Presto&rdquo;; and so conclude.&nbsp; Well, now I will
write and think a little, and so to bed, and dream of MD.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; I have my mouth full of water, and was going to spit
it out, because I reasoned with myself, how could I write when my
mouth was full?&nbsp; Han&rsquo;t you done things like that,
reasoned wrong at first thinking?&nbsp; Well, I was to see Mr.
Lewis this morning, and am to dine a few days hence, as he tells
me, with Mr. Secretary St. John; and I must <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>contrive to
see Harley soon again, to hasten this business from the
Queen.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Lord Mountrath&rsquo;s, <a
name="citation64a"></a><a href="#footnote64a"
class="citation">[64a]</a> with Lord Mountjoy, <a
name="citation64b"></a><a href="#footnote64b"
class="citation">[64b]</a> etc.; but the wine was not good, so I
came away, stayed at the Coffee-house till seven, then came home
to my fire, the maidenhead of my second half-bushel, and am now
in bed at eleven, as usual.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis mighty warm; yet I
fear I should catch cold this wet weather, if I sat an evening in
my room after coming from warm places: and I must make much of
myself, because MD is not here to take care of Presto; and I am
full of business, writing, etc., and do not care for the
Coffee-house; and so this serves for all together, not to tell it
you over and over, as silly people do; but Presto is a wiser man,
faith, than so, let me tell you, gentlewomen.&nbsp; See, I am got
to the third side; but, faith, I will not do that often; but I
must say something early to-day, till the letter is done, and on
Saturday it shall go; so I must leave something till to-morrow,
till to-morrow and next day.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; O Lord, I would this letter was with you with all my
heart!&nbsp; If it should miscarry, what a deal would be
lost!&nbsp; I forgot to leave a gap in the last line but one for
the seal, like a puppy; but I should have allowed for night,
good-night; but when I am taking leave, I cannot leave a bit,
faith; but I fancy the seal will not come there.&nbsp; I dined
to-day at Lady Lucy&rsquo;s, where they ran down my
&ldquo;Shower&rdquo;; and said, &ldquo;Sid Hamet&rdquo; was the
silliest poem they ever read; and told Prior so, whom they
thought to be author of it.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you wonder I never
dined there before?&nbsp; But I am too busy, and they live too
far off; and, besides, I do not like women so much as I
did.&nbsp; (MD, you must know, are not women.)&nbsp; I supped
to-night at Addison&rsquo;s, with Garth, Steele, and Mr. Dopping;
and am come home late.&nbsp; Lewis has sent to me to desire I
will dine with some company I shall like.&nbsp; I suppose it is
Mr. Secretary St. John&rsquo;s appointment.&nbsp; I had a letter
just now from Raymond, who is at Bristol, and says he will be at
London in a fortnight, <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>and leave his wife behind him; and
desires any lodging in the house where I am: but that must not
be.&nbsp; I shall not know what to do with him in town: to be
sure, I will not present him to any acquaintance of mine; and he
will live a delicate life, a parson and a perfect stranger!&nbsp;
Paaast twelvvve o&rsquo;clock, <a name="citation65"></a><a
href="#footnote65" class="citation">[65]</a> and so good-night,
etc.&nbsp; Oh! but I forgot, Jemmy Leigh is come to town; says he
has brought Dingley&rsquo;s things, and will send them with the
first convenience.&nbsp; My parcel, I hear, is not sent
yet.&nbsp; He thinks of going for Ireland in a month, etc.&nbsp;
I cannot write to-morrow, because&mdash;what, because of the
Archbishop; because I will seal my letter early; because I am
engaged from noon till night; because of many kind of things; and
yet I will write one or two words to-morrow morning, to keep up
my journal constant, and at night I will begin my ninth.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Morning by candlelight.&nbsp; You must know that I
am in my nightgown every morning between six and seven, and
Patrick is forced to ply me fifty times before I can get on my
nightgown; and so now I will take my leave of my own dear MD for
this letter, and begin my next when I come home at night.&nbsp;
God Almighty bless and protect dearest MD.&nbsp; Farewell,
etc.</p>
<p>This letter&rsquo;s as long as a sermon, faith.</p>
<h3>LETTER IX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Nov.</i> 11, 1710.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">dined</span> to-day, by invitation, with
the Secretary of State, Mr. St. John.&nbsp; Mr. Harley came in to
us before dinner, and made me his excuses for not dining with us,
because he was to receive people who came to propose advancing
money to the Government: there dined with us only Mr. Lewis, <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>and Dr.
Freind <a name="citation66a"></a><a href="#footnote66a"
class="citation">[66a]</a> (that writ &ldquo;Lord
Peterborow&rsquo;s Actions in Spain&rdquo;).&nbsp; I stayed with
them till just now between ten and eleven, and was forced again
to give my eighth to the bellman, which I did with my own hands,
rather than keep it till next post.&nbsp; The Secretary used me
with all the kindness in the world.&nbsp; Prior came in after
dinner; and, upon an occasion, he (the Secretary) said,
&ldquo;The best thing I ever read is not yours, but Dr.
Swift&rsquo;s on Vanbrugh&rdquo;; which I do not reckon so very
good neither. <a name="citation66b"></a><a href="#footnote66b"
class="citation">[66b]</a>&nbsp; But Prior was damped, until I
stuffed him with two or three compliments.&nbsp; I am thinking
what a veneration we used to have for Sir William Temple, because
he might have been Secretary of State at fifty; and here is a
young fellow, hardly thirty, in that employment. <a
name="citation66c"></a><a href="#footnote66c"
class="citation">[66c]</a>&nbsp; His father is a man of pleasure,
<a name="citation66d"></a><a href="#footnote66d"
class="citation">[66d]</a> that walks the Mall, and frequents St.
James&rsquo;s Coffee-house, and the chocolate-houses; and the
young son is principal Secretary of State.&nbsp; Is there not
something very odd in that?&nbsp; He told me, among other things,
that Mr. Harley complained he could keep nothing from me, I had
the way so much of getting into him.&nbsp; I knew that was a
refinement; and so I told him, and it was so: indeed, it is hard
to see these great men use me like one who was their betters, and
the puppies with you in Ireland hardly regarding me: but <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>there are
some reasons for all this, which I will tell you when we
meet.&nbsp; At coming home, I saw a letter from your mother, in
answer to one I sent her two days ago.&nbsp; It seems she is in
town; but cannot come out in a morning, just as you said; and God
knows when I shall be at leisure in an afternoon: for if I should
send her a penny-post letter, and afterwards not be able to meet
her, it would vex me; and, besides, the days are short, and why
she cannot come early in a morning, before she is wanted, I
cannot imagine.&nbsp; I will desire her to let Lady Giffard know
that she hears I am in town; and that she would go to see me, to
inquire after you.&nbsp; I wonder she will confine herself so
much to that old beast&rsquo;s humour.&nbsp; You know I cannot in
honour see Lady Giffard, <a name="citation67a"></a><a
href="#footnote67a" class="citation">[67a]</a> and consequently
not go into her house.&nbsp; This I think is enough for the first
time.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; And how could you write with such thin paper?&nbsp;
(I forgot to say this in my former.)&nbsp; Cannot you get
thicker?&nbsp; Why, that&rsquo;s a common caution that
writing-masters give their scholars; you must have heard it a
hundred times.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If paper be thin,<br />
Ink will slip in;<br />
But, if it be thick,<br />
You may write with a stick.&rdquo; <a name="citation67b"></a><a
href="#footnote67b" class="citation">[67b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had a letter to-day from poor Mrs. Long, <a
name="citation67c"></a><a href="#footnote67c"
class="citation">[67c]</a> giving me an account of her present
life, obscure in a remote country town, and how easy she is under
it.&nbsp; Poor creature! &rsquo;tis just such an alteration in
life, as if Presto should be banished from MD, and condemned to
converse with Mrs. Raymond.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Ford, Sir
Richard Levinge, <a name="citation67d"></a><a href="#footnote67d"
class="citation">[67d]</a> etc., at a <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>place where they board, <a
name="citation68a"></a><a href="#footnote68a"
class="citation">[68a]</a> hard by.&nbsp; I was lazy, and not
very well, sitting so long with company yesterday.&nbsp; I have
been very busy writing this evening at home, and had a fire: I am
spending my second half-bushel of coals; and now am in bed, and
&rsquo;tis late.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; I dined to-day in the City, and then went to
christen Will Frankland&rsquo;s <a name="citation68b"></a><a
href="#footnote68b" class="citation">[68b]</a> child; and Lady
Falconbridge <a name="citation68c"></a><a href="#footnote68c"
class="citation">[68c]</a> was one of the godmothers: this is a
daughter of Oliver Cromwell, and extremely like him by his
pictures that I have seen.&nbsp; I stayed till almost eleven, and
am now come home and gone to bed.&nbsp; My business in the City
was, to thank Stratford for a kindness he has done me, which now
I will tell you.&nbsp; I found Bank Stock was fallen thirty-four
in the hundred, and was mighty desirous to buy it; but I was a
little too late for the cheapest time, being hindered by business
here; for I was so wise to guess to a day when it would
fall.&nbsp; My project was this: I had three hundred pounds in
Ireland; and so I writ to Mr. Stratford in the City, to desire he
would buy me three hundred pounds in Bank Stock, and that he
should keep the papers, and that I would be bound to pay him for
them; and, if it should rise or fall, I would take my chance, and
pay him interest in the meantime.&nbsp; I showed my letter to one
or two people who understand those things; and they said money
was so hard to be got here, that no man would do it for me.&nbsp;
However, Stratford, who is the most generous man alive, has done
it: but it costs one hundred pounds and a half, that is, ten
shillings; so that three hundred pounds cost me three hundred
pounds and thirty shillings.&nbsp; This was done about a week
ago, and I can have five pounds for my bargain already.&nbsp;
Before it fell, it was one hundred and thirty pounds; and we are
sure it will be the same again.&nbsp; I told you I writ to your
mother, to desire that Lady Giffard <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>would do the same with what she owes
you; but she tells your mother she has no money.&nbsp; I would to
God all you had in the world was there.&nbsp; Whenever you lend
money, take this rule, to have two people bound, who have both
visible fortunes; for they will hardly die together; and, when
one dies, you fall upon the other, and make him add another
security: and if Rathburn (now I have his name) pays you in your
money, let me know, and I will direct Parvisol accordingly:
however, he shall wait on you and know.&nbsp; So, ladies, enough
of business for one night.&nbsp; Paaaaast twelvvve
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I must only add, that, after a long fit of
rainy weather, it has been fair two or three days, and is this
day grown cold and frosty; so that you must give poor little
Presto leave to have a fire in his chamber morning and evening
too; and he will do as much for you.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; What, has your Chancellor <a
name="citation69a"></a><a href="#footnote69a"
class="citation">[69a]</a> lost his senses, like Will Crowe? <a
name="citation69b"></a><a href="#footnote69b"
class="citation">[69b]</a>&nbsp; I forgot to tell Dingley that I
was yesterday at Ludgate, bespeaking the spectacles at the great
shop there, and shall have them in a day or two.&nbsp; This has
been an insipid day.&nbsp; I dined with Mrs. Vanhomrigh, and came
gravely home, after just visiting the Coffee-house.&nbsp; Sir
Richard Cox, <a name="citation69c"></a><a href="#footnote69c"
class="citation">[69c]</a> they say, is sure of going over Lord
Chancellor, who is as arrant a puppy as ever ate bread: but the
Duke of Ormond has a natural affection to puppies; which is a
thousand pities, being none himself.&nbsp; I have been amusing
myself at home till now, and in bed bid you good-night.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; I have been visiting this morning, but nobody was at
home, Secretary St. John, Sir Thomas Hanmer, <a
name="citation69d"></a><a href="#footnote69d"
class="citation">[69d]</a> Sir <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Chancellor Cox-comb, etc.&nbsp; I
attended the Duke of Ormond with about fifty other Irish
gentlemen at Skinners&rsquo; Hall, where the Londonderry Society
laid out three hundred pounds to treat us and his Grace with a
dinner.&nbsp; Three great tables with the dessert laid in mighty
figure.&nbsp; Sir Richard Levinge and I got discreetly to the
head of the second table, to avoid the crowd at the first: but it
was so cold, and so confounded a noise with the trumpets and
hautboys, that I grew weary, and stole away before the second
course came on; so I can give you no account of it, which is a
thousand pities.&nbsp; I called at Ludgate for Dingley&rsquo;s
glasses, and shall have them in a day or two; and I doubt it will
cost me thirty shillings for a microscope, but not without
Stella&rsquo;s permission; for I remember she is a
virtuoso.&nbsp; Shall I buy it or no?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not the
great bulky ones, nor the common little ones, to impale a louse
(saving your presence) upon a needle&rsquo;s point; but of a more
exact sort, and clearer to the sight, with all its equipage in a
little trunk that you may carry in your pocket.&nbsp; Tell me,
sirrah, shall I buy it or not for you?&nbsp; I came home
straight, etc.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; I dined to-day in the city with Mr. Manley, <a
name="citation70"></a><a href="#footnote70"
class="citation">[70]</a> who invited Mr. Addison and me, and
some other friends, to his lodging, and entertained us very
handsomely.&nbsp; I returned with Mr. Addison, and loitered till
nine in the Coffee-house, where I am hardly known, by going so
seldom.&nbsp; I am here soliciting for Trounce; you know him: he
was gunner in the former yacht, and would fain be so in the
present one if you remember him, a good, lusty, fresh-coloured
fellow.&nbsp; Shall I stay till I get another letter from MD
before I close up this?&nbsp; Mr. Addison and I meet a little
seldomer than formerly, although we are still at bottom as good
friends as ever, but differ a little about party.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; To-day I went to Lewis at the Secretary&rsquo;s
office; where I saw and spoke to Mr. Harley, who promised, in a
few days, to finish the rest of my business.&nbsp; I reproached
him for putting me on the necessity of minding him of it, <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>and rallied
him, etc., which he took very well.&nbsp; I dined to-day with one
Mr. Gore, elder brother to a young merchant of my acquaintance;
and Stratford and my other friend merchants dined with us, where
I stayed late, drinking claret and burgundy; and am just got to
bed, and will say no more, but that it now begins to be time to
have a letter from my own little MD; for the last I had above a
fortnight ago, and the date was old too.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; To-day I dined with Lewis and Prior at an
eating-house, but with Lewis&rsquo;s wine.&nbsp; Lewis went away,
and Prior and I sat on, where we complimented one another for an
hour or two upon our mutual wit and poetry.&nbsp; Coming home at
seven, a gentleman unknown stopped me in the Pall Mall, and asked
my advice; said he had been to see the Queen (who was just come
to town), and the people in waiting would not let him see her;
that he had two hundred thousand men ready to serve her in the
war; that he knew the Queen perfectly well, and had an apartment
at Court, and if she heard he was there, she would send for him
immediately; that she owed him two hundred thousand pounds, etc.,
and he desired my opinion, whether he should go try again whether
he could see her; or because, perhaps, she was weary after her
journey, whether he had not better stay till to-morrow.&nbsp; I
had a mind to get rid of my companion, and begged him of all love
to go and wait on her immediately; for that, to my knowledge, the
Queen would admit him; that this was an affair of great
importance, and required despatch: and I instructed him to let me
know the success of his business, and come to the Smyrna
Coffee-house, where I would wait for him till midnight; and so
ended this adventure.&nbsp; I would have fain given the man half
a crown; but was afraid to offer it him, lest he should be
offended; for, beside his money, he said he had a thousand pounds
a year.&nbsp; I came home not early; and so, madams both,
good-night, etc.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; I dined to-day with poor Lord Mountjoy, who is ill
of the gout; and this evening I christened our coffee-man <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>Elliot&rsquo;s <a name="citation72a"></a><a
href="#footnote72a" class="citation">[72a]</a> child, where the
rogue had a most noble supper, and Steele and I sat among some
scurvy company over a bowl of punch; so that I am come home late,
young women, and can&rsquo;t stay to write to little rogues.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; I loitered at home, and dined with Sir Andrew
Fountaine at his lodging, and then came home: a silly day.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; I was visiting all this morning, and then went to
the Secretary&rsquo;s office, and found Mr. Harley, with whom I
dined; and Secretary St. John, etc., and Harley promised in a
very few days to finish what remains of my business.&nbsp; Prior
was of the company, and we all dine at the Secretary&rsquo;s
to-morrow.&nbsp; I saw Stella&rsquo;s mother this morning: she
came early, and we talked an hour.&nbsp; I wish you would propose
to Lady Giffard to take the three hundred pounds out of her
hands, and give her common interest for life, and security that
you will pay her: the Bishop of Clogher, or any friend, would be
security for you, if you gave them counter-security; and it may
be argued that it will pass better to be in your hands than hers,
in case of mortality, etc.&nbsp; Your mother says, if you write,
she will second it; and you may write to your mother, and then it
will come from her.&nbsp; She tells me Lady Giffard has a mind to
see me, by her discourse; but I told her what to say, with a
vengeance.&nbsp; She told Lady Giffard she was going to see me:
she looks extremely well.&nbsp; I am writing <a
name="citation72b"></a><a href="#footnote72b"
class="citation">[72b]</a> in my bed like a tiger; and so
good-night, etc.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; I dined with Secretary St. John; and Lord Dartmouth,
who is t&rsquo;other Secretary, dined with us, and Lord Orrery <a
name="citation72c"></a><a href="#footnote72c"
class="citation">[72c]</a> and Prior, etc.&nbsp; Harley called,
but could not dine with us, and would have had me away while I
was at dinner; but I did <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>not like the company he was to
have.&nbsp; We stayed till eight, and I called at the
Coffee-house, and looked where the letters lie; but no letter
directed for Mr. Presto: at last I saw a letter to Mr. Addison,
and it looked like a rogue&rsquo;s hand; so I made the fellow
give it me, and opened it before him, and saw three letters all
for myself: so, truly, I put them in my pocket, and came home to
my lodging.&nbsp; Well, and so you shall hear: well, and so I
found one of them in Dingley&rsquo;s hand, and t&rsquo;other in
Stella&rsquo;s, and the third in Domville&rsquo;s. <a
name="citation73a"></a><a href="#footnote73a"
class="citation">[73a]</a>&nbsp; Well, so you shall hear; so,
said I to myself, What now, two letters from MD together?&nbsp;
But I thought there was something in the wind; so I opened one,
and I opened t&rsquo;other; and so you shall hear, one was from
Walls.&nbsp; Well, but t&rsquo;other was from our own dear MD;
yes it was.&nbsp; O faith, have you received my seventh, young
women, already?&nbsp; Then I must send this to-morrow, else there
will be old <a name="citation73b"></a><a href="#footnote73b"
class="citation">[73b]</a> doings at our house,
faith.&mdash;Well, I won&rsquo;t answer your letter in this: no,
faith, catch me at that, and I never saw the like.&nbsp; Well;
but as to Walls, tell him (with service to him and wife, etc.)
that I have no imagination of Mr. Pratt&rsquo;s <a
name="citation73c"></a><a href="#footnote73c"
class="citation">[73c]</a> losing his place: and while Pratt
continues, Clements is in no danger; and I have already engaged
Lord Hyde <a name="citation73d"></a><a href="#footnote73d"
class="citation">[73d]</a> he speaks of, for Pratt and twenty
others; but, if such a thing should happen, I will do what I
can.&nbsp; I have above ten businesses of other people&rsquo;s
now on my hands, and, I believe, shall miscarry in half.&nbsp; It
is your sixth I now have received.&nbsp; I writ last post to the
Bishop of Clogher again.&nbsp; Shall I send this to-morrow?&nbsp;
Well, I will, to oblige MD.&nbsp; Which would you rather, a short
letter every week, or a long one every fortnight?&nbsp; A long
one; well, it shall be done, and so good-night.&nbsp; Well, but
is <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>this a
long one?&nbsp; No, I warrant you: too long for naughty
girls.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; I only ask, have you got both the ten pounds, or
only the first; I hope you mean both.&nbsp; Pray be good
housewives; and I beg you to walk when you can, for health.&nbsp;
Have you the horse in town? and do you ever ride him? how
often?&nbsp; Confess.&nbsp; Ahhh, sirrah, have I caught
you?&nbsp; Can you contrive to let Mrs. Fenton <a
name="citation74a"></a><a href="#footnote74a"
class="citation">[74a]</a> know, that the request she has made me
in her letter I will use what credit I have to bring about,
although I hear it is very difficult, and I doubt I shall not
succeed?&nbsp; Cox is not to be your Chancellor: all joined
against him.&nbsp; I have been supping with Lord Peterborow at
his house, with Prior, Lewis, and Dr. Freind.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
the ramblingest lying rogue on earth.&nbsp; Dr. Raymond is come
to town: &rsquo;tis late, and so I bid you good-night.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; I tell you, pretty management!&nbsp; Ned Southwell
told me the other day he had a letter from the bishops of
Ireland, with an address to the Duke of Ormond, to intercede with
the Queen to take off the First-Fruits.&nbsp; I dined with him
to-day, and saw it, with another letter to him from the Bishop of
Kildare, <a name="citation74b"></a><a href="#footnote74b"
class="citation">[74b]</a> to call upon me for the papers, etc.;
and I had last post one from the Archbishop of Dublin, telling me
the reason of this proceeding; that, upon hearing the Duke of
Ormond was declared Lord Lieutenant, they met; and the bishops
were for this project, and talked coldly of my being solicitor,
as one that was favoured by t&rsquo;other party, etc., but
desired that I would still solicit. <a name="citation74c"></a><a
href="#footnote74c" class="citation">[74c]</a>&nbsp; Now the
wisdom of this is admirable; for I had given the Archbishop an <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>account of my
reception from Mr. Harley, and how he had spoken to the Queen,
and promised it should be done; but Mr. Harley ordered me to tell
no person alive.&nbsp; Some time after, he gave me leave to let
the Primate and Archbishop know that the Queen had remitted the
First-Fruits; and that in a short time they should have an
account of it in form from Lord Dartmouth, Secretary of
State.&nbsp; So while their letter was on the road to the Duke of
Ormond and Southwell, mine was going to them with an account of
the thing being done.&nbsp; I writ a very warm answer <a
name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75"
class="citation">[75]</a> to the Archbishop immediately; and
showed my resentments, as I ought, against the bishops; only, in
good manners, excepting himself.&nbsp; I wonder what they will
say when they hear the thing is done.&nbsp; I was yesterday
forced to tell Southwell so, that the Queen had done it, etc.;
for he said, my Lord Duke would think of it some months hence,
when he was going for Ireland; and he had it three years in doing
formerly, without any success.&nbsp; I give you free leave to
say, on occasion, that it is done; and that Mr. Harley prevailed
on the Queen to do it, etc., as you please.&nbsp; As I hope to
live, I despise the credit of it, out of an excess of pride; and
desire you will not give me the least merit when you talk of it;
but I would vex the bishops, and have it spread that Mr. Harley
had done it: pray do so.&nbsp; Your mother sent me last night a
parcel of wax candles, and a bandbox full of small
plumcakes.&nbsp; I thought it had been something for you; and,
without opening them, sent answer by the maid that brought them,
that I would take care to send the things, etc.; but I will write
her thanks.&nbsp; Is this a long letter, sirrahs?&nbsp; Now, are
you satisfied?&nbsp; I have had no fit since the first: I drink
brandy every morning, and take pills every night.&nbsp; Never
fear, I an&rsquo;t vexed at this puppy business of the bishops,
<a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>although I
was a little at first.&nbsp; I will tell you my reward: Mr.
Harley will think he has done me a favour; the Duke of Ormond,
perhaps, that I have put a neglect on him; and the bishops in
Ireland, that I have done nothing at all.&nbsp; So goes the
world.&nbsp; But I have got above all this, and, perhaps, I have
better reason for it than they know: and so you shall hear no
more of First-Fruits, dukes, Harleys, archbishops, and
Southwells.</p>
<p>I have slipped off Raymond upon some of his countrymen, to
show him the town, etc., and I lend him Patrick.&nbsp; He desires
to sit with me in the evenings; upon which I have given Patrick
positive orders that I am not within at evenings.</p>
<h3>LETTER X.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Nov.</i> 25, 1710.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">will</span> tell you something
that&rsquo;s plaguy silly: I had forgot to say on the 23d in my
last, where I dined; and because I had done it constantly, I
thought it was a great omission, and was going to interline it;
but at last the silliness of it made me cry, Pshah, and I let it
alone.&nbsp; I was to-day to see the Parliament meet; but only
saw a great crowd; and Ford and I went to see the tombs at
Westminster, and sauntered so long I was forced to go to an
eating-house for my dinner.&nbsp; Bromley <a
name="citation76a"></a><a href="#footnote76a"
class="citation">[76a]</a> is chosen Speaker, <i>nemine
contradicente</i>: Do you understand those two words?&nbsp; And
Pompey, Colonel Hill&rsquo;s <a name="citation76b"></a><a
href="#footnote76b" class="citation">[76b]</a> black, designs to
stand Speaker for the footmen. <a name="citation76c"></a><a
href="#footnote76c" class="citation">[76c]</a>&nbsp; I am <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>engaged to
use my interest for him, and have spoken to Patrick to get him
some votes.&nbsp; We are now all impatient for the Queen&rsquo;s
speech, what she will say about removing the Ministry, etc.&nbsp;
I have got a cold, and I don&rsquo;t know how; but got it I have,
and am hoarse: I don&rsquo;t know whether it will grow better or
worse.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that to you?&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t answer
your letter to-night.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll keep you a little longer
in suspense: I can&rsquo;t send it.&nbsp; Your mother&rsquo;s
cakes are very good, and one of them serves me for a breakfast,
and so I&rsquo;ll go sleep like a good boy.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; I have got a cruel cold, and stayed within all this
day in my nightgown, and dined on sixpennyworth of victuals, and
read and writ, and was denied to everybody.&nbsp; Dr. Raymond <a
name="citation77a"></a><a href="#footnote77a"
class="citation">[77a]</a> called often, and I was denied; and at
last, when I was weary, I let him come up, and asked him, without
consequence, how Patrick denied me, and whether he had the art of
it?&nbsp; So by this means he shall be used to have me denied to
him; otherwise he would be a plaguy trouble and hindrance to me:
he has sat with me two hours, and drank a pint of ale cost me
fivepence, and smoked his pipe, and it is now past eleven that he
is just gone.&nbsp; Well, my eighth is with you now, young women;
and your seventh to me is somewhere in a post-boy&rsquo;s bag;
and so go to your gang of deans, and Stoytes, and Walls, and lose
your money; go, sauceboxes: and so good-night, and be happy, dear
rogues.&nbsp; Oh, but your box was sent to Dr. Hawkshaw by
Sterne, and you will have it with Hawkshaw, and spectacles, etc.,
etc.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; To-day Mr. Harley met me in the Court of Requests,
<a name="citation77b"></a><a href="#footnote77b"
class="citation">[77b]</a> <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>and whispered me to dine with
him.&nbsp; At dinner I told him what those bishops had done, and
the difficulty I was under.&nbsp; He bid me never trouble myself;
he would tell the Duke of Ormond the business was done, and that
he need not concern himself about it.&nbsp; So now I am easy, and
they may hang themselves for a parcel of insolent, ungrateful
rascals.&nbsp; I suppose I told you in my last, how they sent an
address to the Duke of Ormond, and a letter to Southwell, to call
on me for the papers, after the thing was over; but they had not
received my letter, though the Archbishop might, by what I writ
to him, have expected it would be done.&nbsp; Well, there is an
end of that; and in a little time the Queen will send them
notice, etc.&nbsp; And so the methods will be settled; and then I
shall think of returning, although the baseness of those bishops
makes me love Ireland less than I did.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; Lord Halifax sent to invite me to dinner; where I
stayed till six, and crossed him in all his Whig talk, and made
him often come over to me.&nbsp; I know he makes court to the new
men, although he affects to talk like a Whig.&nbsp; I had a
letter to-day from the Bishop of Clogher; but I writ to him
lately, that I would obey his commands to the Duke of
Ormond.&nbsp; He says I bid him read the London
&ldquo;Shaver,&rdquo; and that you both swore it was
&ldquo;Shaver,&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Shower.&rdquo; <a
name="citation78a"></a><a href="#footnote78a"
class="citation">[78a]</a>&nbsp; You all lie, and you are
puppies, and can&rsquo;t read Presto&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; The
Bishop is out entirely in his conjectures of my share in the
<i>Tatlers</i>.&mdash;I have other things to mind, and of much
greater importance; <a name="citation78b"></a><a
href="#footnote78b" class="citation">[78b]</a> else I have little
to do to be acquainted with a new Ministry, who consider me a
little more than Irish bishops do.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; Now for your saucy, good dear letter: let me see,
what does it say? come then.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Ford, and
went home early; he debauched <a name="citation78c"></a><a
href="#footnote78c" class="citation">[78c]</a> me to his chamber
again <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>with
a bottle of wine till twelve: so good-night.&nbsp; I cannot write
an answer now, you rogues.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; To-day I have been visiting, which I had long
neglected; and I dined with Mrs. Barton alone; and sauntered at
the Coffee-house till past eight, and have been busy till eleven,
and now I&rsquo;ll answer your letter, saucebox.&nbsp; Well, let
me see now again.&nbsp; My wax candle&rsquo;s almost out, but
however I&rsquo;ll begin.&nbsp; Well then, do not be so tedious,
Mr. Presto; what can you say to MD&rsquo;s letter?&nbsp; Make
haste, have done with your preambles&mdash;Why, I say I am glad
you are so often abroad; your mother thinks it is want of
exercise hurts you, and so do I.&nbsp; (She called here to-night,
but I was not within, that&rsquo;s by the bye.)&nbsp; Sure you do
not deceive me, Stella, when you say you are in better health
than you were these three weeks; for Dr. Raymond told me
yesterday, that Smyth of the Blind Quay had been telling Mr.
Leigh that he left you extremely ill; and in short, spoke so,
that he almost put poor Leigh into tears, and would have made me
run distracted; though your letter is dated the 11th instant, and
I saw Smyth in the city above a fortnight ago, as I passed by in
a coach.&nbsp; Pray, pray, don&rsquo;t write, Stella, until you
are mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty well in your eyes, and are
sure it won&rsquo;t do you the least hurt.&nbsp; Or come,
I&rsquo;ll tell you what; you, Mistress Stella, shall write your
share at five or six sittings, one sitting a day; and then comes
Dingley all together, and then Stella a little crumb towards the
end, to let us see she remembers Presto; and then conclude with
something handsome and genteel, as your most humblecumdumble, or,
etc.&nbsp; O Lord! does Patrick write word of my not coming till
spring?&nbsp; Insolent man! he know my secrets?&nbsp; No; as my
Lord Mayor said, No; if I thought my shirt knew, etc.&nbsp;
Faith, I will come as soon as it is any way proper for me to
come; but, to say the truth, I am at present a little involved
with the <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>present Ministry in some certain things (which I tell
you as a secret); and soon as ever I can clear my hands, I will
stay no longer; for I hope the First-Fruit business will be soon
over in all its forms.&nbsp; But, to say the truth, the present
Ministry have a difficult task, and want me, etc.&nbsp; Perhaps
they may be just as grateful as others: but, according to the
best judgment I have, they are pursuing the true interest of the
public; and therefore I am glad to contribute what is in my
power.&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s sake, not a word of this to any
alive.&mdash;Your Chancellor? <a name="citation80a"></a><a
href="#footnote80a" class="citation">[80a]</a>&nbsp; Why, madam,
I can tell you he has been dead this fortnight.&nbsp; Faith, I
could hardly forbear our little language about a nasty dead
Chancellor, as you may see by the blot. <a
name="citation80b"></a><a href="#footnote80b"
class="citation">[80b]</a>&nbsp; Ploughing?&nbsp; A pox plough
them; they&rsquo;ll plough me to nothing.&nbsp; But have you got
your money, both the ten pounds?&nbsp; How durst he pay you the
second so soon?&nbsp; Pray be good huswifes.&nbsp; Ay, well, and
Joe, why, I had a letter lately from Joe, desiring I would take
some care of their poor town, <a name="citation80c"></a><a
href="#footnote80c" class="citation">[80c]</a> who, he says, will
lose their liberties.&nbsp; To which I desired Dr. Raymond would
return answer, that the town had behaved themselves so ill to me,
so little regarded the advice I gave them, and disagreed so much
among themselves, that I was resolved never to have more to do
with them; but that whatever personal kindness I could do to Joe,
should be done.&nbsp; Pray, when you happen to see Joe, tell him
this, lest Raymond should have blundered or forgotten&mdash;Poor
Mrs. Wesley!&mdash;Why these poligyes <a
name="citation80d"></a><a href="#footnote80d"
class="citation">[80d]</a> for being abroad?&nbsp; Why should you
be at home at all, until Stella is quite well?&mdash;So, here is
Mistress Stella again, with her two eggs, etc.&nbsp; My
&ldquo;Shower&rdquo; admired with you; why, the Bishop of Clogher
says, he has seen something of mine of the same sort, better than
the &ldquo;Shower.&rdquo;&nbsp; I suppose he means &ldquo;The
Morning&rdquo;; <a name="citation80e"></a><a href="#footnote80e"
class="citation">[80e]</a> but it is not half so good.&nbsp; I
want your judgment of things, and not your country&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
How does MD like it? <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>and do they taste it <i>all</i>?
etc.&nbsp; I am glad Dean Bolton <a name="citation81a"></a><a
href="#footnote81a" class="citation">[81a]</a> has paid the
twenty pounds.&nbsp; Why should not I chide the Bishop of Clogher
for writing to the Archbishop of Cashel, <a
name="citation81b"></a><a href="#footnote81b"
class="citation">[81b]</a> without sending the letter first to
me?&nbsp; It does not signify a &mdash;; for he has no credit at
Court.&nbsp; Stuff&mdash;they are all puppies.&nbsp; I will break
your head in good earnest, young woman, for your nasty jest about
Mrs. Barton. <a name="citation81c"></a><a href="#footnote81c"
class="citation">[81c]</a>&nbsp; Unlucky sluttikin, what a word
is there!&nbsp; Faith, I was thinking yesterday, when I was with
her, whether she could break them or no, and it quite spoilt my
imagination.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Walls, does Stella win as she
pretends?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No indeed, Doctor; she loses
always, and will play so <i>ventersomely</i>, how can she
win?&rdquo;&nbsp; See here now; an&rsquo;t you an impudent lying
slut?&nbsp; Do, open Domville&rsquo;s letter; what does it
signify, if you have a mind?&nbsp; Yes, faith, you write smartly
with your eyes shut; all was well but the <i>n</i>.&nbsp; See how
I can do it; <i>Madam Stella</i>, <i>your humble servant</i>. <a
name="citation81d"></a><a href="#footnote81d"
class="citation">[81d]</a>&nbsp; O, but one may look whether one
goes crooked or no, and so write on.&nbsp; I will tell you what
you may do; you may write with your eyes half shut, just as when
one is going to sleep: I have done so for two or three lines now;
it is but just seeing enough to go straight.&mdash;Now, Madam
Dingley, I think I bid you tell Mr. Walls that, in case there be
occasion, I will serve his friend as far as I can; but I hope
there will be none.&nbsp; Yet I believe you will have a new
Parliament; but I care not whether you have or no a better.&nbsp;
You are mistaken in all your conjectures about the
<i>Tatlers</i>.&nbsp; I have given him one or two hints, and you
have heard me talk about the Shilling. <a
name="citation81e"></a><a href="#footnote81e"
class="citation">[81e]</a>&nbsp; Faith, these answering letters
are very long ones: you have taken up almost the room of a week
in journals; and I will tell you what, I saw fellows wearing
crosses to-day, <a name="citation81f"></a><a href="#footnote81f"
class="citation">[81f]</a> and I wondered what was the matter;
but just this minute I recollect it is little Presto&rsquo;s
birthday; and I was resolved <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>these three days to remember it when
it came, but could not.&nbsp; Pray, drink my health to-day at
dinner; do, you rogues.&nbsp; Do you like &ldquo;Sid
Hamet&rsquo;s Rod&rdquo;?&nbsp; Do you understand it all?&nbsp;
Well, now at last I have done with your letter, and so I will lay
me down to sleep, and about, fair maids; and I hope merry maids
all.</p>
<p>Dec. 1.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I wish Smyth were hanged.&nbsp; I
was dreaming the most melancholy things in the world of poor
Stella, and was grieving and crying all night.&mdash;Pshah, it is
foolish: I will rise and divert myself; so good-morrow; and God
of His infinite mercy keep and protect you!&nbsp; The Bishop of
Clogher&rsquo;s letter is dated Nov. 21.&nbsp; He says you
thought of going with him to Clogher.&nbsp; I am heartily glad of
it, and wish you would ride there, and Dingley go in a
coach.&nbsp; I have had no fit since my first, although sometimes
my head is not quite in good order.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I was
this morning to visit Mr. Pratt, who is come over with poor, sick
Lord Shelburne: they made me dine with them; and there I stayed,
like a booby, till eight, looking over them at ombre, and then
came home.&nbsp; Lord Shelburne&rsquo;s giddiness is turned into
a colic, and he looks miserably.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Steele, the rogue, has done the imprudentest thing in
the world: he said something in a <i>Tatler</i>, <a
name="citation82a"></a><a href="#footnote82a"
class="citation">[82a]</a> that we ought to use the word Great
Britain, and not England, in common conversation, as, &ldquo;The
finest lady in Great Britain,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; Upon this, Rowe,
Prior, and I sent him a letter, turning this into ridicule.&nbsp;
He has to-day printed the letter, <a name="citation82b"></a><a
href="#footnote82b" class="citation">[82b]</a> and signed it
J.S., M.P., and N.R., the first letters of all our names.&nbsp;
Congreve told me to-day, he smoked it immediately.&nbsp; Congreve
and I, and Sir Charles Wager, dined to-day at Delaval&rsquo;s,
the Portugal Envoy; and I stayed there till eight, and came home,
and am now writing to you before I do business, because that dog
Patrick is not at home, and the fire is not made, and I am not in
my gear.&nbsp; Pox take him!&mdash;I was looking by chance at the
top of this side, and find I make plaguy mistakes in words; so
that you must fence against that as well as bad <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>writing.&nbsp; Faith, I can&rsquo;t nor won&rsquo;t read
what I have written.&nbsp; (Pox of this puppy!) Well, I&rsquo;ll
leave you till I am got to bed, and then I will say a word or
two.&mdash;Well, &rsquo;tis now almost twelve, and I have been
busy ever since, by a fire too (I have my coals by half a bushel
at a time, I&rsquo;ll assure you), and now I am got to bed.&nbsp;
Well, and what have you to say to Presto now he is abed?&nbsp;
Come now, let us hear your speeches.&nbsp; No, &rsquo;tis a lie;
I an&rsquo;t sleepy yet.&nbsp; Let us sit up a little longer, and
talk.&nbsp; Well, where have you been to-day, that you are but
just this minute come home in a coach?&nbsp; What have you
lost?&nbsp; Pay the coachman, Stella.&nbsp; No, faith, not I,
he&rsquo;ll grumble.&mdash;What new acquaintance have you got?
come, let us hear.&nbsp; I have made Delaval promise to send me
some Brazil tobacco from Portugal for you, Madam Dingley.&nbsp; I
hope you will have your chocolate and spectacles before this
comes to you.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Pshaw, I must be writing to these dear saucy brats
every night, whether I will or no, let me have what business I
will, or come home ever so late, or be ever so sleepy; but an old
saying, and a true one,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Be you lords, or be you earls,<br />
You must write to naughty girls.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was to-day at Court, and saw Raymond among the Beefeaters,
staying to see the Queen: so I put him in a better station, made
two or three dozen of bows, and went to church, and then to Court
again, to pick up a dinner, as I did with Sir John Stanley; and
then we went to visit Lord Mountjoy, and just now left him; and
&rsquo;tis near eleven at night, young women; and methinks this
letter comes pretty near to the bottom, and &rsquo;tis but eight
days since the date, and don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll write on
the other side, I thank you for nothing.&nbsp; Faith, if I would
use you to letters on sheets as broad as this room, you would
always expect them from me.&nbsp; O, faith, I know you well
enough; but an old saying, etc.,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Two sides in a sheet,<br />
And one in a street.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>I think
that&rsquo;s but a silly old saying; and so I&rsquo;ll go to
sleep, and do you so too.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Mrs. Vanhomrigh, and then came
home, and studied till eleven.&nbsp; No adventure at all
to-day.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; So I went to the Court of Requests (we have had the
Devil and all of rain by the bye) to pick up a dinner; and Henley
made me go dine with him and one Colonel Bragg <a
name="citation84a"></a><a href="#footnote84a"
class="citation">[84a]</a> at a tavern; cost me money,
faith.&nbsp; Congreve was to be there, but came not.&nbsp; I came
with Henley to the Coffee-house, where Lord Salisbury <a
name="citation84b"></a><a href="#footnote84b"
class="citation">[84b]</a> seemed mighty desirous to talk with
me; and, while he was wriggling himself into my favour, that dog
Henley asked me aloud, whether I would go to see Lord Somers as I
had promised (which was a lie); and all to vex poor Lord
Salisbury, who is a high Tory.&nbsp; He played two or three other
such tricks; and I was forced to leave my lord, and I came home
at seven, and have been writing ever since, and will now go to
bed.&nbsp; The other day I saw Jack Temple <a
name="citation84c"></a><a href="#footnote84c"
class="citation">[84c]</a> in the Court of Requests: it was the
first time of seeing him; so we talked two or three careless
words, and parted.&nbsp; Is it true that your Recorder and Mayor,
and fanatic aldermen, a month or two ago, at a solemn feast,
drank Mr. Harley&rsquo;s, Lord Rochester&rsquo;s, <a
name="citation84d"></a><a href="#footnote84d"
class="citation">[84d]</a> and other Tory healths?&nbsp; Let me
know; it was confidently said here.&mdash;The scoundrels!&nbsp;
It shan&rsquo;t do, Tom.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; When is this letter to go, I wonder? harkee, young
women, tell me that.&nbsp; Saturday next for certain, and not
before: then it will be just a fortnight; time enough for naughty
girls, and long enough for two letters, faith.&nbsp; Congreve and
Delaval have at last prevailed on Sir Godfrey Kneller to entreat
me to let him draw my picture for nothing; but I know not yet
when I shall sit. <a name="citation84e"></a><a
href="#footnote84e" class="citation">[84e]</a>&mdash;It is such
monstrous rainy weather, that there is no doing with it.&nbsp;
Secretary St. John sent to me this morning, that my dining <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>with him
to-day was put off till to-morrow; so I peaceably sat with my
neighbour Ford, dined with him, and came home at six, and am now
in bed as usual; and now it is time to have another letter from
MD, yet I would not have it till this goes; for that would look
like two letters for one.&nbsp; Is it not whimsical that the Dean
has never once written to me?&nbsp; And I find the Archbishop
very silent to that letter I sent him with an account that the
business was done.&nbsp; I believe he knows not what to write or
say; and I have since written twice to him, both times with a
vengeance. <a name="citation85a"></a><a href="#footnote85a"
class="citation">[85a]</a>&nbsp; Well, go to bed, sirrahs, and so
will I.&nbsp; But have you lost to-day?&nbsp; Three
shillings!&nbsp; O fie, O fie!</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; No, I won&rsquo;t send this letter to-day, nor till
Saturday, faith; and I am so afraid of one from MD between this
and that; if it comes, I will just say I received a letter, and
that is all.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Mr. Secretary St. John,
where were Lord Anglesea, <a name="citation85b"></a><a
href="#footnote85b" class="citation">[85b]</a> Sir Thomas Hanmer,
Prior, Freind, etc., and then made a debauch after nine at
Prior&rsquo;s house, and have eaten cold pie, and I hate the
thoughts of it, and I am full, and I don&rsquo;t like it, and I
will go to bed, and it is late, and so good-night.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; To-day I dined with Mr. Harley and Prior; but Mr. St.
John did not come, though he promised: he chid me for not seeing
him oftener.&nbsp; Here is a damned, libellous pamphlet come out
against Lord Wharton, giving the character first, and then
telling some of his actions: the character is very well, but the
facts indifferent. <a name="citation85c"></a><a
href="#footnote85c" class="citation">[85c]</a>&nbsp; It has been
sent by dozens to several gentlemen&rsquo;s lodgings, and I had
one or two of them; but nobody knows the author or printer.&nbsp;
We are terribly afraid of the plague; they say it is at <a

of God to take some care about it, or we are all ruined.&nbsp;
There have been orders for all ships from the Baltic to pass
their quarantine before they land; but they neglect it.&nbsp; You
remember I have been afraid these two years.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; O, faith, you are a saucy rogue.&nbsp; I have had
your sixth letter just now, before this is gone; but I will not
answer a word of it, only that I never was giddy since my first
fit; but I have had a cold just a fortnight, and cough with it
still morning and evening; but it will go off.&nbsp; It is,
however, such abominable weather that no creature can walk.&nbsp;
They say here three of your Commissioners will be turned out,
Ogle, South, and St. Quintin; <a name="citation86b"></a><a
href="#footnote86b" class="citation">[86b]</a> and that Dick
Stewart <a name="citation86c"></a><a href="#footnote86c"
class="citation">[86c]</a> and Ludlow will be two of the new
ones.&nbsp; I am a little soliciting for another: it is poor Lord
Abercorn, <a name="citation86d"></a><a href="#footnote86d"
class="citation">[86d]</a> but that is a secret; I mean, that I
befriend him is a secret; but I believe it is too late, by his
own fault and ill fortune.&nbsp; I dined with him to-day.&nbsp; I
am heartily sorry you do not go to Clogher, faith, I am; and so
God Almighty protect poor, dear, dear, dear, dearest MD.&nbsp;
Farewell till to-night.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll begin my eleventh
to-night; so I am always writing to little MD.</p>
<h3>LETTER XI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Dec.</i> 9, 1710.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">So</span>, young women, I have just sent
my tenth to the post-office, and, as I told you, have received
your seventh (faith, I am afraid I mistook, and said your sixth,
and then we shall be all in confusion this month.)&nbsp; Well, I
told you I dined with Lord Abercorn to-day; and that is enough
till <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>by
and bye; for I must go write idle things, and twittle twattle. <a
name="citation87a"></a><a href="#footnote87a"
class="citation">[87a]</a>&nbsp; What&rsquo;s here to do with
your little MD&rsquo;s? and so I put this by for a while.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis now late, and I can only say MD is a dear, saucy
rogue, and what then?&nbsp; Presto loves them the better.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; This son of a b&mdash; Patrick is out of the way,
and I can do nothing; am forced to borrow coals: &rsquo;tis now
six o&rsquo;clock, and I am come home after a pure walk in the
park; delicate weather, begun only to-day.&nbsp; A terrible storm
last night: we hear one of your packet-boats is cast away, and
young Beau Swift <a name="citation87b"></a><a href="#footnote87b"
class="citation">[87b]</a> in it, and General Sankey: <a
name="citation87c"></a><a href="#footnote87c"
class="citation">[87c]</a>&nbsp; I know not the truth; you will
before me.&nbsp; Raymond talks of leaving the town in a few days,
and going in a month to Ireland, for fear his wife should be too
far gone, and forced to be brought to bed here.&nbsp; I think he
is in the right; but perhaps this packet-boat will fright
him.&nbsp; He has no relish for London; and I do not wonder at
it.&nbsp; He has got some Templars from Ireland that show him the
town.&nbsp; I do not let him see me above twice a week, and that
only while I am dressing in the morning.&mdash;So, now the
puppy&rsquo;s come in, and I have got my own ink, but a new pen;
and so now you are rogues and sauceboxes till I go to bed; for I
must go study, sirrahs.&nbsp; Now I think of it, tell the Bishop
of Clogher, he shall not cheat me of one inch of my bell
metal.&nbsp; You know it is nothing but to save the town money;
and Enniskillen can afford it better than Laracor: he shall have
but one thousand five hundred weight.&nbsp; I have been reading,
etc., as usual, and am now going to bed; and I find this
day&rsquo;s article is long enough: so get you gone till
to-morrow, and then.&nbsp; I dined with Sir Matthew Dudley.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; I am come home again as yesterday, and the puppy had
again locked up my ink, notwithstanding all I said to <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>him
yesterday; but he came home a little after me, so all is well:
they are lighting my fire, and I&rsquo;ll go study.&nbsp; The
fair weather is gone again, and it has rained all day.&nbsp; I do
not like this open weather, though some say it is healthy.&nbsp;
They say it is a false report about the plague at Newcastle. <a
name="citation88a"></a><a href="#footnote88a"
class="citation">[88a]</a>&nbsp; I have no news to-day: I dined
with Mrs. Vanhomrigh, to desire them to buy me a scarf; and Lady
Abercorn <a name="citation88b"></a><a href="#footnote88b"
class="citation">[88b]</a> is to buy me another, to see who does
best: mine is all in rags.&nbsp; I saw the Duke of Richmond <a
name="citation88c"></a><a href="#footnote88c"
class="citation">[88c]</a> yesterday at Court again, but would
not speak to him: I believe we are fallen out.&nbsp; I am now in
bed; and it has rained all this evening, like wildfire: have you
so much rain in your town?&nbsp; Raymond was in a fright, as I
expected, upon the news of this shipwreck; but I persuaded him,
and he leaves this town in a week.&nbsp; I got him acquainted
with Sir Robert Raymond, <a name="citation88d"></a><a
href="#footnote88d" class="citation">[88d]</a> the
Solicitor-General, who owns him to be of his family; and I
believe it may do him a kindness, by being recommended to your
new Lord Chancellor.&mdash;I had a letter from Mrs. Long, that
has quite turned my stomach against her: no less than two nasty
jests in it, with dashes to suppose them.&nbsp; She is corrupted
in that country town <a name="citation88e"></a><a
href="#footnote88e" class="citation">[88e]</a> with vile
conversation.&mdash;I will not answer your letter till I have
leisure: so let this go on as it will, what care I? what cares
saucy Presto?</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; I was to-day at the Secretary&rsquo;s office with
Lewis, and in came Lord Rivers; <a name="citation88f"></a><a
href="#footnote88f" class="citation">[88f]</a> who took Lewis out
and whispered <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>him; and then came up to me to desire my acquaintance,
etc., so we bowed and complimented a while, and parted and I
dined with Phil. Savage <a name="citation89a"></a><a
href="#footnote89a" class="citation">[89a]</a> and his Irish
Club, at their boarding-place; and, passing an evening scurvily
enough, did not come home till eight.&nbsp; Mr. Addison and I
hardly meet once a fortnight; his Parliament and my different
friendships keep us asunder.&nbsp; Sir Matthew Dudley turned away
his butler yesterday morning; and at night the poor fellow died
suddenly in the streets: was not it an odd event?&nbsp; But what
care you?&nbsp; But then I knew the butler.&mdash;Why, it seems
your packet-boat is not lost: psha, how silly that is, when I had
already gone through the forms, and said it was a sad thing, and
that I was sorry for it!&nbsp; But when must I answer this letter
of our MD&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Here it is, it lies between this paper
on t&rsquo;other side of the leaf: one of these
odd-come-shortly&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll consider, and so
good-night.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I am to go trapesing with Lady Kerry
<a name="citation89b"></a><a href="#footnote89b"
class="citation">[89b]</a> and Mrs. Pratt <a
name="citation89c"></a><a href="#footnote89c"
class="citation">[89c]</a> to see sights all this day: they
engaged me yesterday morning at tea.&nbsp; You hear the havoc
making in the army: Meredith, Maccartney, and Colonel Honeywood
<a name="citation89d"></a><a href="#footnote89d"
class="citation">[89d]</a> are obliged to sell their commands at
half-value, and leave <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>the army, for drinking destruction to
the present Ministry, and dressing up a hat on a stick, and
calling it Harley; then drinking a glass with one hand, and
discharging a pistol with the other at the maukin, <a
name="citation90a"></a><a href="#footnote90a"
class="citation">[90a]</a> wishing it were Harley himself; and a
hundred other such pretty tricks, as inflaming their soldiers,
and foreign Ministers, against the late changes at Court.&nbsp;
Cadogan <a name="citation90b"></a><a href="#footnote90b"
class="citation">[90b]</a> has had a little paring: his mother <a
name="citation90c"></a><a href="#footnote90c"
class="citation">[90c]</a> told me yesterday he had lost the
place of Envoy; but I hope they will go no further with him, for
he was not at those mutinous meetings.&mdash;Well, these saucy
jades take up so much of my time with writing to them in a
morning; but, faith, I am glad to see you whenever I can: a
little snap and away; and so hold your tongue, for I must rise:
not a word, for your life.&nbsp; How nowww?&nbsp; So, very well;
stay till I come home, and then, perhaps, you may hear further
from me.&nbsp; And where will you go to-day, for I can&rsquo;t be
with you for these ladies?&nbsp; It is a rainy, ugly day.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d have you send for Walls, and go to the Dean&rsquo;s;
but don&rsquo;t play small games when you lose.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll be ruined by Manilio, Basto, the queen, and two
small trumps, in red. <a name="citation90d"></a><a
href="#footnote90d" class="citation">[90d]</a>&nbsp; I confess
&rsquo;tis a good hand against the player: but then there are
Spadilio, Punto, the king, strong trumps, against you, which,
with one trump more, are three tricks ten ace: for, suppose you
play your Manilio&mdash;Oh, silly, how I prate, and can&rsquo;t
get away from this MD in a morning!&nbsp; Go, get you gone, dear
naughty girls, and let me rise.&nbsp; There, Patrick locked up my
ink again the third time last night: the rogue gets the better of
me; but I will rise in spite of you, sirrahs.&mdash;At
night.&nbsp; Lady Kerry, Mrs. Pratt, Mrs. Cadogan, <a
name="citation90e"></a><a href="#footnote90e"
class="citation">[90e]</a> and I, in one coach; Lady
Kerry&rsquo;s <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>son <a name="citation91a"></a><a href="#footnote91a"
class="citation">[91a]</a> and his governor, and two gentlemen,
in another; maids, and misses and little master (Lord
Shelburne&rsquo;s <a name="citation91b"></a><a
href="#footnote91b" class="citation">[91b]</a> children), in a
third, all hackneys, set out at ten o&rsquo;clock this morning
from Lord Shelburne&rsquo;s house in Piccadilly to the Tower, and
saw all the sights, lions, <a name="citation91c"></a><a
href="#footnote91c" class="citation">[91c]</a> etc.; then to
Bedlam; <a name="citation91d"></a><a href="#footnote91d"
class="citation">[91d]</a> then dined at the chop-house behind
the Exchange; then to Gresham College <a
name="citation91e"></a><a href="#footnote91e"
class="citation">[91e]</a> (but the keeper was not at home); and
concluded the night at the Puppet-show, <a
name="citation91f"></a><a href="#footnote91f"
class="citation">[91f]</a> whence we came home safe at eight, and
I left them.&nbsp; The ladies were all in mobs <a
name="citation91g"></a><a href="#footnote91g"
class="citation">[91g]</a> (how do you call it?), undrest; and it
was the rainiest day that ever dripped; and I am weary; and it is
now past eleven.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; Stay, I&rsquo;ll answer some of your letter this
morning in bed: let me see; come and appear, little letter.&nbsp;
Here I am, says he: and what say you to Mrs. MD this morning
fresh and fasting?&nbsp; Who dares think MD negligent?&nbsp; I
allow them a fortnight; and they give it me.&nbsp; I could fill a
letter in a week; but it is longer every day; and so I keep it a
fortnight, and then &rsquo;tis cheaper by one half.&nbsp; I have
never been giddy, dear Stella, since that morning: I have taken a
whole box of pills, and kecked <a name="citation91h"></a><a
href="#footnote91h" class="citation">[91h]</a> at them every
night, and drank a pint of brandy at mornings.&mdash;Oh then, <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>you kept
Presto&rsquo;s little birthday: <a name="citation92a"></a><a
href="#footnote92a" class="citation">[92a]</a> would to God I had
been with you!&nbsp; I forgot it, as I told you before.&nbsp;
R<i>e</i>diculous, madam?&nbsp; I suppose you mean
r<i>i</i>diculous: let me have no more of that; &rsquo;tis the
author of the <i>Atalantis&rsquo;s</i> <a
name="citation92b"></a><a href="#footnote92b"
class="citation">[92b]</a> spelling.&nbsp; I have mended it in
your letter.&nbsp; And can Stella read this writing without
hurting her dear eyes?&nbsp; O, faith, I am afraid not.&nbsp;
Have a care of those eyes, pray, pray, pretty
Stella.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis well enough what you observe, that, if I
writ better, perhaps you would not read so well, being used to
this manner; &rsquo;tis an alphabet you are used to: you know
such a pot-hook makes a letter; and you know what letter, and so
and so.&mdash;I&rsquo;ll swear he told me so, and that they were
long letters too; but I told him it was a gasconnade of yours,
etc.&nbsp; I am talking of the Bishop of Clogher, how he
forgot.&nbsp; Turn over. <a name="citation92c"></a><a
href="#footnote92c" class="citation">[92c]</a>&nbsp; I had not
room on t&rsquo;other side to say that, so I did it on this: I
fancy that&rsquo;s a good Irish blunder.&nbsp; Ah, why do not you
go down to Clogher, nautinautinautideargirls; I dare not say
<i>nauti</i> without <i>dear</i>: O, faith, you govern me.&nbsp;
But, seriously, I&rsquo;m sorry you don&rsquo;t go, as far as I
can judge at this distance.&nbsp; No, we would get you another
horse; I will make Parvisol get you one.&nbsp; I always doubted
that horse of yours: prythee sell him, and let it be a present to
me.&nbsp; My heart aches when I think you ride him.&nbsp; Order
Parvisol to sell him, and that you are to return me the money: I
shall never be easy until he is out of your hands.&nbsp; Faith, I
have dreamt five or six times of horses stumbling since I had
your letter.&nbsp; If he can&rsquo;t sell <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>him, let him
run this winter.&nbsp; Faith, if I was near you, I would whip
your &mdash; to some tune, for your grave, saucy answer about the
Dean and <i>Johnsonibus</i>; I would, young women.&nbsp; And did
the Dean preach for me? <a name="citation93a"></a><a
href="#footnote93a" class="citation">[93a]</a>&nbsp; Very
well.&nbsp; Why, would they have me stand here and preach to
them?&nbsp; No, the <i>Tatler</i> of the Shilling <a
name="citation93b"></a><a href="#footnote93b"
class="citation">[93b]</a> was not mine, more than the hint, and
two or three general heads for it.&nbsp; I have much more
important business on my hands; and, besides, the Ministry hate
to think that I should help him, and have made reproaches on it;
and I frankly told them I would do it no more.&nbsp; This is a
secret though, Madam Stella.&nbsp; You win eight shillings? you
win eight fiddlesticks.&nbsp; Faith, you say nothing of what you
lose, young women.&mdash;I hope Manley is in no great danger; for
Ned Southwell is his friend, and so is Sir Thomas Frankland; and
his brother John Manley stands up heartily for him.&nbsp; On
t&rsquo;other side, all the gentlemen of Ireland here are
furiously against him.&nbsp; Now, Mistress Dingley, an&rsquo;t
you an impudent slut, to expect a letter next packet from Presto,
when you confess yourself that you had so lately two letters in
four days?&nbsp; Unreasonable baggage!&nbsp; No, little Dingley,
I am always in bed by twelve; I mean my candle is out by twelve,
and I take great care of myself.&nbsp; Pray let everybody know,
upon occasion, that Mr. Harley got the First-Fruits from the
Queen for the clergy of Ireland, and that nothing remains but the
forms, etc.&nbsp; So you say the Dean and you dined at
Stoyte&rsquo;s, and Mrs. Stoyte was in raptures that I remembered
her.&nbsp; I must do it but seldom, or it will take off her
rapture. But what now, you saucy sluts? all this written in a
morning, and I must rise and go abroad.&nbsp; Pray stay till
night: do not think I will squander mornings upon you, pray, good
madam.&nbsp; Faith, if I go on longer in this trick of writing in
the morning, I shall be afraid of leaving it off, and think you
expect it, and be in awe.&nbsp; Good-morrow, sirrahs, I will
rise.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I went to-day to the Court of
Requests (I will not answer the rest of your letter yet, that by
the way), in <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>hopes to dine with Mr. Harley: but Lord Dupplin, <a
name="citation94a"></a><a href="#footnote94a"
class="citation">[94a]</a> his son-in-law, told me he did not
dine at home; so I was at a loss, until I met with Mr. Secretary
St. John, and went home and dined with him, where he told me of a
good bite. <a name="citation94b"></a><a href="#footnote94b"
class="citation">[94b]</a>&nbsp; Lord Rivers told me two days
ago, that he was resolved to come Sunday fortnight next to hear
me preach before the Queen.&nbsp; I assured him the day was not
yet fixed, and I knew nothing of it.&nbsp; To-day the Secretary
told me that his father, Sir Harry St. John, <a
name="citation94c"></a><a href="#footnote94c"
class="citation">[94c]</a> and Lord Rivers were to be at St.
James&rsquo;s Church, to hear me preach there; and were assured I
was to preach: so there will be another bite; for I know nothing
of the matter, but that Mr. Harley and St. John are resolved I
must preach before the Queen; and the Secretary of State has told
me he will give me three weeks&rsquo; warning; but I desired to
be excused, which he will not.&nbsp; St. John, &ldquo;You shall
not be excused&rdquo;: however, I hope they will forget it; for
if it should happen, all the puppies hereabouts will throng to
hear me, and expect something wonderful, and be plaguily baulked;
for I shall preach plain honest stuff.&nbsp; I stayed with St.
John till eight, and then came home; and Patrick desired leave to
go abroad, and by and by comes up the girl to tell me, a
gentleman was below in a coach, who had a bill to pay me; so I
let him come up, and who should it be but Mr. Addison and Sam
Dopping, to haul me out to supper, where I stayed till
twelve.&nbsp; If Patrick had been at home, I should have
&rsquo;scaped this; for I have taught him to deny me almost as
well as Mr. Harley&rsquo;s porter.&mdash;Where did I leave off in
MD&rsquo;s letter? let me see.&nbsp; So, now I have it.&nbsp; You
are pleased to say, Madam <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>Dingley, that those who go for
England can never tell when to come back.&nbsp; Do you mean this
as a reflection upon Presto, madam?&nbsp; Sauceboxes, I will come
back as soon as I can, as hope saved, <a
name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a"
class="citation">[95a]</a> and I hope with some advantage, unless
all Ministries be alike, as perhaps they may.&nbsp; I hope
Hawkshaw is in Dublin before now, and that you have your things,
and like your spectacles: if you do not, you shall have
better.&nbsp; I hope Dingley&rsquo;s tobacco did not spoil
Stella&rsquo;s chocolate, and that all is safe: pray let me
know.&nbsp; Mr. Addison and I are different as black and white,
and I believe our friendship will go off, by this damned business
of party: he cannot bear seeing me fall in so with this Ministry:
but I love him still as well as ever, though we seldom
meet.&mdash;Hussy, Stella, you jest about poor Congreve&rsquo;s
eyes; <a name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b"
class="citation">[95b]</a> you do so, hussy; but I&rsquo;ll bang
your bones, faith.&mdash;Yes, Steele was a little while in
prison, or at least in a spunging-house, some time before I came,
but not since. <a name="citation95c"></a><a href="#footnote95c"
class="citation">[95c]</a>&mdash;Pox on your convocations, and
your Lamberts; <a name="citation95d"></a><a href="#footnote95d"
class="citation">[95d]</a> they write with a vengeance!&nbsp; I
suppose you think it a piece of affectation in me to wish your
Irish folks would not like my &ldquo;Shower,&rdquo;; but you are
mistaken.&nbsp; I should be glad to have the general applause
there as I have here (though I say it); but I have only that of
one or two, and therefore I would have none at all, but let you
all be in the wrong.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know, this is not what I
would say; but I am so tosticated with supper and stuff, that I
can&rsquo;t express myself.&mdash;What you say of &ldquo;Sid
Hamet&rdquo; is well enough; that an enemy should like it, and a
friend not; and that telling the author would make both change
their opinions.&nbsp; Why did you not tell Griffyth <a
name="citation95e"></a><a href="#footnote95e"
class="citation">[95e]</a> that you fancied there was something
<a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>in it of
my manner; but first spur up his commendation to the height, as
we served my poor uncle about the sconce that I mended?&nbsp;
Well, I desired you to give what I intended for an answer to Mrs.
Fenton, <a name="citation96a"></a><a href="#footnote96a"
class="citation">[96a]</a> to save her postage, and myself
trouble; and I hope I have done it, if you han&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; Lord, what a long day&rsquo;s writing was
yesterday&rsquo;s answer to your letter, sirrahs!&nbsp; I dined
to-day with Lewis and Ford, whom I have brought acquainted.&nbsp;
Lewis told me a pure thing.&nbsp; I had been hankering with Mr.
Harley to save Steele his other employment, and have a little
mercy on him; and I had been saying the same thing to Lewis, who
is Mr. Harley&rsquo;s chief favourite.&nbsp; Lewis tells Mr.
Harley how kindly I should take it, if he would be reconciled to
Steele, etc.&nbsp; Mr. Harley, on my account, falls in with it,
and appoints Steele a time to let him attend him, which Steele
accepts with great submission, but never comes, nor sends any
excuse.&nbsp; Whether it was blundering, sullenness, insolence,
or rancour of party, I cannot tell; but I shall trouble myself no
more about him.&nbsp; I believe Addison hindered him out of mere
spite, being grated <a name="citation96b"></a><a
href="#footnote96b" class="citation">[96b]</a> to the soul to
think he should ever want my help to save his friend; yet now he
is soliciting me to make another of his friends Queen&rsquo;s
Secretary at Geneva; and I&rsquo;ll do it if I can; it is poor
Pastoral Philips. <a name="citation96c"></a><a
href="#footnote96c" class="citation">[96c]</a></p>
<p>16.&nbsp; O, why did you leave my picture behind you at
t&rsquo;other lodgings?&nbsp; Forgot it?&nbsp; Well; but pray
remember it now, and don&rsquo;t roll it up, d&rsquo;ye hear; but
hang it carefully in some part of your room, where chairs and
candles and mop-sticks won&rsquo;t spoil it, sirrahs.&nbsp; No,
truly, I will not be <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>godfather to Goody Walls this bout,
and I hope she will have no more.&nbsp; There will be no quiet
nor cards for this child.&nbsp; I hope it will die the day after
the christening.&nbsp; Mr. Harley gave me a paper, with an
account of the sentence you speak of against the lads that
defaced the statue, <a name="citation97a"></a><a
href="#footnote97a" class="citation">[97a]</a> and that Ingoldsby
<a name="citation97b"></a><a href="#footnote97b"
class="citation">[97b]</a> reprieved that part of it of standing
before the statue.&nbsp; I hope it was never executed.&nbsp; We
have got your Broderick out; <a name="citation97c"></a><a
href="#footnote97c" class="citation">[97c]</a> Doyne <a
name="citation97d"></a><a href="#footnote97d"
class="citation">[97d]</a> is to succeed him, and Cox <a
name="citation97e"></a><a href="#footnote97e"
class="citation">[97e]</a> Doyne.&nbsp; And so there&rsquo;s an
end of your letter; &rsquo;tis all answered; and now I must go on
upon my own stock.&nbsp; Go on, did I say?&nbsp; Why, I have
written enough; but this is too soon to send it yet, young women;
faith, I dare not use you to it, you&rsquo;ll always expect it;
what remains shall be only short journals of a day, and so
I&rsquo;ll rise for this morning.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I dined
with my opposite neighbour, Darteneuf; and I was soliciting this
day to present the Bishop of Clogher Vice-Chancellor; <a
name="citation97f"></a><a href="#footnote97f"
class="citation">[97f]</a> but it won&rsquo;t do; they are all
set against him, and the Duke of Ormond, they say, has resolved
to dispose of it somewhere else.&nbsp; Well; little saucy rogues,
do not stay out too late to-night, because it is Saturday night,
and young women should come home soon then.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; I went to Court to seek a dinner: but the Queen was
not at church, she has got a touch of the gout; so the Court <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>was thin, and
I went to the Coffee-house; and Sir Thomas Frankland and his
eldest son and I went and dined with his son William. <a
name="citation98a"></a><a href="#footnote98a"
class="citation">[98a]</a>&nbsp; I talked a great deal to Sir
Thomas about Manley; and find he is his good friend, and so has
Ned Southwell been, and I hope he will be safe, though all the
Irish folks here are his mortal enemies.&nbsp; There was a
devilish bite to-day.&nbsp; They had it, I know not how, that I
was to preach this morning at St. James&rsquo;s Church; an
abundance went, among the rest Lord Radnor, who never is abroad
till three in the afternoon.&nbsp; I walked all the way home from
Hatton Garden at six, by moonlight, a delicate night.&nbsp;
Raymond called at nine, but I was denied; and now I am in bed
between eleven and twelve, just going to sleep, and dream of my
own dear roguish impudent pretty MD.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; You will now have short days&rsquo; works, just a
few lines to tell you where I am, and what I am doing; only I
will keep room for the last day to tell you news, if there be any
worth sending.&nbsp; I have been sometimes like to do it at the
top of my letter, until I remark it would be old before it
reached you.&nbsp; I was hunting to dine with Mr. Harley to-day,
but could not find him; and so I dined with honest Dr. Cockburn,
and came home at six, and was taken out to next door by Dopping
and Ford, to drink bad claret and oranges; and we let Raymond
come to us, who talks of leaving the town to-morrow, but I
believe will stay a day or two longer.&nbsp; It is now late, and
I will say no more, but end this line with bidding my own dear
saucy MD good-night, etc.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; I am come down proud stomach in one instance, for I
went to-day to see the Duke of Buckingham, <a
name="citation98b"></a><a href="#footnote98b"
class="citation">[98b]</a> but came too late: then I visited Mrs.
Barton, <a name="citation98c"></a><a href="#footnote98c"
class="citation">[98c]</a> and thought to have dined with some of
the Ministry; but it rained, and Mrs. Vanhomrigh <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>was nigh, and
I took the opportunity of paying her for a scarf she bought me,
and dined there; at four I went to congratulate with Lord
Shelburne, for the death of poor Lady Shelburne dowager; <a
name="citation99a"></a><a href="#footnote99a"
class="citation">[99a]</a> he was at his country house, and
returned while I was there, and had not heard of it, and he took
it very well.&nbsp; I am now come home before six, and find a
packet from the Bishop of Clogher, with one enclosed to the Duke
of Ormond, which is ten days earlier dated than another I had
from Parvisol; however, &rsquo;tis no matter, for the Duke has
already disposed of the Vice-Chancellorship to the Archbishop of
Tuam, <a name="citation99b"></a><a href="#footnote99b"
class="citation">[99b]</a> and I could not help it, for it is a
thing wholly you know in the Duke&rsquo;s power; and I find the
Bishop has enemies about the Duke.&nbsp; I write this while
Patrick is folding up my scarf, and doing up the fire (for I keep
a fire, it costs me twelvepence a week); and so be quiet till I
am gone to bed, and then sit down by me a little, and we will
talk a few words more.&nbsp; Well; now MD is at my bedside; and
now what shall we say?&nbsp; How does Mrs. Stoyte?&nbsp; What had
the Dean for supper?&nbsp; How much did Mrs. Walls win?&nbsp;
Poor Lady Shelburne: well, go get you to bed, sirrahs.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I was up this morning early, and
shaved by candlelight, and write this by the fireside.&nbsp; Poor
Raymond just came in and took his leave of me; he is summoned by
high order from his wife, but pretends he has had enough of
London.&nbsp; I was a little melancholy to part with him; he goes
to Bristol, where they are to be with his merchant brother, and
now thinks of staying till May; so she must be brought to bed in
England.&nbsp; He was so easy and manageable, that I almost
repent I suffered him to see me so seldom.&nbsp; But he is gone,
and will save Patrick some lies in a week: Patrick is grown
admirable at it, and will make his fortune.&nbsp; <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>How now,
sirrah, must I write in a morning to your impudence?</p>
<blockquote><p>Stay till night,<br />
And then I&rsquo;ll write,<br />
In black and white,<br />
By candlelight,<br />
Of wax so bright,<br />
It helps the sight&mdash;<br />
A bite, a bite!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marry come up, Mistress Boldface.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; Dr.
Raymond came back, and goes to-morrow.&nbsp; I did not come home
till eleven, and found him here to take leave of me.&nbsp; I went
to the Court of Requests, thinking to find Mr. Harley and dine
with him, and refused Henley, and everybody, and at last knew not
where to go, and met Jemmy Leigh by chance, and he was just in
the same way, so I dined at his lodgings on a beef-steak, and
drank your health; then left him and went to the tavern with Ben
Tooke and Portlack, the Duke of Ormond&rsquo;s secretary,
drinking nasty white wine till eleven.&nbsp; I am sick, and
ashamed of it, etc.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; I met that beast Ferris, Lord Berkeley&rsquo;s <a
name="citation100a"></a><a href="#footnote100a"
class="citation">[100a]</a> steward formerly; I walked with him a
turn in the Park, and that scoundrel dog is as happy as an
emperor, has married a wife with a considerable estate in land
and houses about this town, and lives at his ease at
Hammersmith.&nbsp; See your confounded sect! <a
name="citation100b"></a><a href="#footnote100b"
class="citation">[100b]</a>&nbsp; Well; I had the same luck
to-day with Mr. Harley; &rsquo;twas a lovely day, and went by
water into the City, and dined with Stratford at a
merchant&rsquo;s house, and walked home with as great a dunce as
Ferris, I mean honest Colonel Caulfeild, <a
name="citation100c"></a><a href="#footnote100c"
class="citation">[100c]</a> and came home by eight, and now am in
bed, and going to sleep for a wager, and will send this letter on
Saturday, and so; but first I will wish you a merry <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Christmas
and a happy New Year, and pray God we may never keep them asunder
again.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I am going now to Mr. Harley&rsquo;s
levee on purpose to vex him; I will say I had no other way of
seeing him, etc.&nbsp; Patrick says it is a dark morning, and
that the Duke of Argyle <a name="citation101a"></a><a
href="#footnote101a" class="citation">[101a]</a> is to be
knighted to-day; the booby means installed at Windsor.&nbsp; But
I must rise, for this is a shaving-day, and Patrick says there is
a good fire; I wish MD were by it, or I by MD&rsquo;s.&mdash;At
night.&nbsp; I forgot to tell you, Madam Dingley, that I paid
nine shillings for your glass and spectacles, of which three were
for the Bishop&rsquo;s case: I am sorry I did not buy you such
another case; but if you like it, I will bring one over with me;
pray tell me: the glass to read was four shillings, the
spectacles two.&nbsp; And have you had your chocolate?&nbsp;
Leigh says he sent the petticoat by one Mr. Spencer.&nbsp; Pray
have you no further commissions for me?&nbsp; I paid the
glass-man but last night, and he would have made me a present of
the microscope worth thirty shillings, and would have sent it
home along with me; I thought the deuce was in the man: he said I
could do him more service than that was worth, etc.&nbsp; I
refused his present, but promised him all service I could do him;
and so now I am obliged in honour to recommend him to
everybody.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I went to Mr. Harley&rsquo;s
levee; he came and asked me what I had to do there, and bid me
come and dine with him on a family dinner; which I did, and it
was the first time I ever saw his lady <a
name="citation101b"></a><a href="#footnote101b"
class="citation">[101b]</a> and daughter; <a
name="citation101c"></a><a href="#footnote101c"
class="citation">[101c]</a> at five my Lord Keeper <a
name="citation101d"></a><a href="#footnote101d"
class="citation">[101d]</a> came in: I <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>told Mr.
Harley, he had formerly presented me to Sir Simon Harcourt, but
now must to my Lord Keeper; so he laughed, etc.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; This letter goes to-night without
fail; I hope there is none from you yet at the Coffee-house; I
will send and see by and by, and let you know, and so and
so.&nbsp; Patrick goes to see for a letter: what will you lay, is
there one from MD or no?&nbsp; No, I say; done for
sixpence.&nbsp; Why has the Dean never once written to me?&nbsp;
I won sixpence; I won sixpence; there is not one letter to
Presto.&nbsp; Good-morrow, dear sirrahs: Stratford and I dine
to-day with Lord Mountjoy.&nbsp; God Almighty preserve and bless
you; farewell, etc.</p>
<p>I have been dining at Lord Mountjoy&rsquo;s; and am come to
study; our news from Spain this post takes off some of our
fears.&nbsp; The Parliament is prorogued to-day, or adjourned
rather till after the holidays.&nbsp; Bank Stock is 105, so I may
get 12 shillings for my bargain already.&nbsp; Patrick, the
puppy, is abroad, and how shall I send this letter?&nbsp;
Good-night, little dears both, and be happy; and remember your
poor Presto, that wants you sadly, as hope saved.&nbsp; Let me go
study, naughty girls, and don&rsquo;t keep me at the bottom of
the paper.&nbsp; O, faith, if you knew what lies on my hands
constantly, you would wonder to see how I could write such long
letters; but we&rsquo;ll talk of that some other time.&nbsp;
Good-night again, and God bless dear MD with His best blessings,
yes, yes, and Dingley and Stella and me too, etc.</p>
<p>Ask the Bishop of Clogher about the pun I sent him of Lord
Stawel&rsquo;s brother; <a name="citation102"></a><a
href="#footnote102" class="citation">[102]</a> it will be a pure
bite.&nbsp; This letter has 199 lines in it, beside all
postscripts; I had a curiosity to reckon.</p>
<p>There is a long letter for you.</p>
<p>It is longer than a sermon, faith.</p>
<p>I had another letter from Mrs. Fenton, who says you were <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>with her; I
hope you did not go on purpose.&nbsp; I will answer her letter
soon; it is about some money in Lady Giffard&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>They say you have had eight packets due to you; so pray,
madams, do not blame Presto, but the wind.</p>
<p>My humble service to Mrs. Walls and Mrs. Stoyte; I missed the
former a good while.</p>
<h3>LETTER XII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Dec.</i> 23, 1710.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> sent my 11th to-night as
usual, and begin the dozenth, and I told you I dined with
Stratford at Lord Mountjoy&rsquo;s, and I will tell you no more
at present, guess for why; because I am going to mind things, and
mighty affairs, not your nasty First-Fruits&mdash;I let them
alone till Mr. Harley gets the Queen&rsquo;s letter&mdash;but
other things of greater moment, that you shall know one day, when
the ducks have eaten up all the dirt.&nbsp; So sit still a while
just by me, while I am studying, and don&rsquo;t say a word, I
charge you, and when I am going to bed, I will take you along,
and talk with you a little while, so there, sit there.&mdash;Come
then, let us see what we have to say to these saucy brats, that
will not let us go sleep at past eleven.&nbsp; Why, I am a little
impatient to know how you do; but that I take it for a standing
maxim, that when you are silent, all is pretty well, because that
is the way I will deal with you; and if there was anything you
ought to know now, I would write by the first post, although I
had written but the day before.&nbsp; Remember this, young women;
and God Almighty preserve you both, and make us happy together;
and tell me how accompts stand between us, that you may be paid
long before it is due, not to want.&nbsp; I will return no more
money while I stay, so that you need not be in pain to be paid;
but let me know at least a month before you can want.&nbsp;
Observe this, d&rsquo;ye hear, little dear sirrahs, and love
Presto, as Presto loves MD, etc.</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>24.&nbsp; You will have a merrier Christmas Eve than we
here.&nbsp; I went up to Court before church; and in one of the
rooms, there being but little company, a fellow in a red coat
without a sword came up to me, and, after words of course, asked
me how the ladies did?&nbsp; I asked, &ldquo;What
ladies?&rdquo;&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;Mrs. Dingley and Mrs.
Johnson.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;when I heard from them last: and pray when came you from
thence, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;I never was in
Ireland&rdquo;; and just at that word Lord Winchelsea <a
name="citation104a"></a><a href="#footnote104a"
class="citation">[104a]</a> comes up to me, and the man went off:
as I went out I saw him again, and recollected him, it was Vedeau
<a name="citation104b"></a><a href="#footnote104b"
class="citation">[104b]</a> with a pox: I then went and made my
apologies, that my head was full of something I had to say to
Lord Winchelsea, etc., and I asked after his wife, and so all was
well; and he inquired after my lodging, because he had some
favour to desire of me in Ireland, to recommend somebody to
somebody, I know not what it is.&nbsp; When I came from church, I
went up to Court again, where Sir Edmond Bacon <a
name="citation104c"></a><a href="#footnote104c"
class="citation">[104c]</a> told me the bad news from Spain, <a
name="citation104d"></a><a href="#footnote104d"
class="citation">[104d]</a> which you will hear before this
reaches you; as we have it now, we are undone there, and it was
odd to see the whole countenances of the Court changed so in two
hours.&nbsp; Lady Mountjoy <a name="citation104e"></a><a
href="#footnote104e" class="citation">[104e]</a> carried me home
to dinner, where I stayed not long after, and came home early,
and now am got into bed, for you must always write to your
MD&rsquo;s in bed, that is a maxim.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. White and Mr. Red,<br />
Write to MD when abed;<br />
Mr. Black and Mr. Brown,<br />
Write to MD when you&rsquo;re down;<br />
Mr. Oak and Mr. Willow,<br />
Write to MD on your pillow.&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>What
is this? faith, I smell fire; what can it be? this house has a
thousand stinks in it.&nbsp; I think to leave it on Thursday, and
lodge over the way.&nbsp; Faith, I must rise, and look at my
chimney, for the smell grows stronger, stay&mdash;I have been up,
and in my room, and found all safe, only a mouse within the
fender to warm himself, which I could not catch.&nbsp; I smelt
nothing there, but now in my bed-chamber I smell it again; I
believe I have singed the woollen curtain, and that is all,
though I cannot smoke it.&nbsp; Presto is plaguy silly to-night,
an&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; Yes, and so he be.&nbsp; Ay, but if I should
wake and see fire.&nbsp; Well; I will venture; so good-night,
etc.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; Pray, young women, if I write so much as this every
day, how will this paper hold a fortnight&rsquo;s work, and
answer one of yours into the bargain?&nbsp; You never think of
this, but let me go on like a simpleton.&nbsp; I wish you a merry
Christmas, and many, many a one with poor Presto at some pretty
place.&nbsp; I was at church to-day by eight, and received the
Sacrament, and came home by ten; then went to Court at two: it
was a Collar-day, that is, when the Knights of the Garter wear
their collars; but the Queen stayed so late at Sacrament, that I
came back, and dined with my neighbour Ford, because all people
dine at home on this day.&nbsp; This is likewise a Collar-day all
over England in every house, at least where there is
<i>brawn</i>: that&rsquo;s very well.&mdash;I tell you a good
pun; a fellow hard by pretends to cure agues, and has set out a
sign, and spells it <i>egoes</i>; a gentleman and I observing it,
he said, &ldquo;How does that fellow pretend to cure
<i>agues</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; I said I did not know; but I was sure
it was not by a <i>spell</i>.&nbsp; That is admirable.&nbsp; And
so you asked the Bishop about that pun of Lord Stawel&rsquo;s
brother.&nbsp; Bite!&nbsp; Have I caught you, young women?&nbsp;
Must you pretend to ask after roguish puns, and Latin ones
too?&nbsp; Oh but you smoked me, and did not ask the
Bishop.&nbsp; Oh but you are a fool, and you did.&nbsp; I met
Vedeau again at Court to-day, and I observed he had a sword on; I
fancy he was broke, and has got a commission, but I never asked
him.&nbsp; Vedeau I think his name is, yet Parvisol&rsquo;s man
is Vedel, that is true.&nbsp; Bank Stock will fall like
stock-fish by this bad news, <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>and two days ago I could have got
twelve pounds by my bargain; but I do not intend to sell, and in
time it will rise.&nbsp; It is odd that my Lord Peterborow
foretold this loss two months ago, one night at Mr.
Harley&rsquo;s, when I was there; he bid us count upon it, that
Stanhope would lose Spain before Christmas; that he would venture
his head upon it, and gave us reasons; and though Mr. Harley
argued the contrary, he still held to his opinion.&nbsp; I was
telling my Lord Angelsea this at Court this morning; and a
gentleman by said he had heard my Lord Peterborow affirm the same
thing.&nbsp; I have heard wise folks say, &ldquo;An ill tongue
may do much.&rdquo;&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis an odd saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Once I guessed right,<br />
And I got credit by&rsquo;t;<br />
Thrice I guessed wrong,<br />
And I kept my credit on.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, it is you are sorry, not I.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; By the Lord Harry, I shall be undone here with
Christmas boxes.&nbsp; The rogues of the Coffee-house have raised
their tax, everyone giving a crown; and I gave mine for shame,
besides a great many half-crowns to great men&rsquo;s porters,
etc.&nbsp; I went to-day by water into the city, and dined with
no less a man than the City Printer. <a
name="citation106a"></a><a href="#footnote106a"
class="citation">[106a]</a>&nbsp; There is an intimacy between
us, built upon reasons that you shall know when I see you; but
the rain caught me within twelvepenny length of home.&nbsp; I
called at Mr. Harley&rsquo;s, who was not within, dropped my
half-crown with his porter, drove to the Coffee-house, where the
rain kept me till nine.&nbsp; I had letters to-day from the
Archbishop of Dublin and Mr. Bernage; <a
name="citation106b"></a><a href="#footnote106b"
class="citation">[106b]</a> the latter sends me a melancholy
account of Lady Shelburne&rsquo;s <a name="citation106c"></a><a
href="#footnote106c" class="citation">[106c]</a> <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>death, and
his own disappointments, and would gladly be a captain; if I can
help him, I will.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I bespoke a lodging over the way for
to-morrow, and the dog let it yesterday to another; I gave him no
earnest, so it seems he could do it; Patrick would have had me
give him earnest to bind him; but I would not.&nbsp; So I must go
saunter to-day for a lodging somewhere else.&nbsp; Did you ever
see so open a winter in England?&nbsp; We have not had two frosty
days; but it pays it off in rain: we have not had three fair days
these six weeks.&nbsp; O, faith, I dreamt mightily of MD last
night; but so confused, I cannot tell a word.&nbsp; I have made
Ford acquainted with Lewis; and to-day we dined together: in the
evening I called at one or two neighbours, hoping to spend a
Christmas evening; but none were at home, they were all gone to
be merry with others.&nbsp; I have often observed this, that in
merry times everybody is abroad; where the deuce are they?&nbsp;
So I went to the Coffee-house, and talked with Mr. Addison an
hour, who at last remembered to give me two letters, which I
cannot answer to-night, nor to-morrow neither, I can assure you,
young women, count upon that.&nbsp; I have other things to do
than to answer naughty girls, an old saying and true,</p>
<blockquote><p>Letters from MD&rsquo;s<br />
Must not be answered in ten days:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it is but bad rhyme, etc.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; To-day I had a message from Sir Thomas Hanmer, to
dine with him; the famous Dr. Smalridge <a
name="citation107a"></a><a href="#footnote107a"
class="citation">[107a]</a> was of the company, and we sat till
six; and I came home to my new lodgings in St. Albans Street, <a
name="citation107b"></a><a href="#footnote107b"
class="citation">[107b]</a> where I pay the same rent (eight
shillings a week) for an apartment two pair of stairs; but I have
the use of the parlour to receive persons of quality, and I am
got into my new bed, etc.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>29.&nbsp; Sir Andrew Fountaine has been very ill this
week; and sent to me early this morning to have prayers, which
you know is the last thing.&nbsp; I found the doctors and all in
despair about him.&nbsp; I read prayers to him, found he had
settled all things; and, when I came out, the nurse asked me
whether I thought it possible he could live; for the doctors
thought not.&nbsp; I said, I believed he would live; for I found
the seeds of life in him, which I observe seldom fail (and I
found them in poor, dearest Stella, when she was ill many years
ago); and to-night I was with him again, and he was mightily
recovered, and I hope he will do well, and the doctor approved my
reasons; but, if he should die, I should come off scurvily.&nbsp;
The Secretary of State (Mr. St. John) sent to me to dine with
him; Mr. Harley and Lord Peterborow dined there too; and at night
came Lord Rivers.&nbsp; Lord Peterborow goes to Vienna in a day
or two: he has promised to make me write to him.&nbsp; Mr. Harley
went away at six; but we stayed till seven.&nbsp; I took the
Secretary aside, and complained to him of Mr. Harley, that he had
got the Queen to grant the First-Fruits, promised to bring me to
her, and get her letter to the bishops of Ireland; but the last
part he had not done in six weeks, and I was in danger to lose
reputation, etc.&nbsp; He took the matter right, desired me to be
with him on Sunday morning, and promises me to finish the affair
in four days; so I shall know in a little time what I have to
trust to.&mdash;It is nine o&rsquo;clock, and I must go study,
you little rogues; and so good-night, etc.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; The weather grows cold, you
sauceboxes.&nbsp; Sir Andrew Fountaine, they bring me word, is
better.&nbsp; I will go rise, for my hands are starving while I
write in bed.&nbsp; Night.&nbsp; Now Sir Andrew Fountaine is
recovering, he desires to be at ease; for I called in the morning
to read prayers, but he had given orders not to be
disturbed.&nbsp; I have lost a legacy by his living; for he told
me he had left me a picture and some books, etc.&nbsp; I called
to see my quondam neighbour Ford (do you know what <i>quondam</i>
is, though?), and he engaged me to dine with him; for he always
dines at home on Opera-days.&nbsp; I came home at six, writ to
the Archbishop, <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>then studied till past eleven, and stole to bed, to
write to MD these few lines, to let you know I am in good health
at the present writing hereof, and hope in God MD is so
too.&nbsp; I wonder I never write politics to you: I could make
you the profoundest politician in all the lane.&mdash;Well, but
when shall we answer this letter, No. 8 of MD&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Not
till next year, faith.&nbsp; O Lord&mdash;bo&mdash;but that will
be a Monday next.&nbsp; Cod&rsquo;s-so, is it? and so it is:
never saw the like.&mdash;I made a pun t&rsquo;other day to Ben
Portlack <a name="citation109"></a><a href="#footnote109"
class="citation">[109]</a> about a pair of drawers.&nbsp; Poh,
said he, that&rsquo;s mine a&mdash; all over.&nbsp; Pray, pray,
Dingley, let me go sleep; pray, pray, Stella, let me go slumber;
and put out my wax-candle.</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; It is now seven, and I have got a
fire, but am writing abed in my bed-chamber.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not
shaving-day, so I shall be ready early to go before church to Mr.
St. John; and to-morrow I will answer our MD&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<blockquote><p>Would you answer MD&rsquo;s letter,<br />
On New Year&rsquo;s Day you&rsquo;ll do it better;<br />
For, when the year with MD &rsquo;gins,<br />
It without MD never lins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(These proverbs have always old words in them; lins is leave
off.)</p>
<blockquote><p>But, if on New Year you write nones,<br />
MD then will bang your bones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Patrick says I must rise.&mdash;Night.&nbsp; I was early
this morning with Secretary St. John, and gave him a memorial to
get the Queen&rsquo;s letter for the First-Fruits, who has
promised to do it in a very few days.&nbsp; He told me he had
been with the Duke of Marlborough, who was lamenting his former
wrong steps in joining with the Whigs, and said he was worn out
with age, fatigues, and misfortunes.&nbsp; I swear it pitied me;
and I really think they will not do well in too much mortifying
that man, although indeed it is his own fault.&nbsp; He is
covetous as hell, and ambitious as the Prince of it: he would
fain have been General for life, and has broken all endeavours
for peace, to keep his greatness and <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>get money.&nbsp; He told the Queen
he was neither covetous nor ambitious.&nbsp; She said if she
could have conveniently turned about, she would have laughed, and
could hardly forbear it in his face.&nbsp; He fell in with all
the abominable measures of the late Ministry, because they
gratified him for their own designs.&nbsp; Yet he has been a
successful General, and I hope he will continue his
command.&nbsp; O Lord, smoke the politics to MD!&nbsp; Well; but,
if you like them, I will scatter a little now and then, and mine
are all fresh from the chief hands.&nbsp; Well, I dined with Mr.
Harley, and came away at six: there was much company, and I was
not merry at all.&nbsp; Mr. Harley made me read a paper of verses
of Prior&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I read them plain, without any fine
manner; and Prior swore, I should never read any of his again;
but he would be revenged, and read some of mine as bad.&nbsp; I
excused myself, and said I was famous for reading verses the
worst in the world; and that everybody snatched them from me when
I offered to begin.&nbsp; So we laughed.&mdash;Sir Andrew
Fountaine still continues ill.&nbsp; He is plagued with some sort
of bile.</p>
<p>Jan. 1.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I wish my dearest, pretty Dingley
and Stella a happy New Year, and health, and mirth, and good
stomachs, and Fr&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; Faith, I did not know how
to write Fr.&nbsp; I wondered what was the matter; but now I
remember I always write Pdfr.&nbsp; Patrick wishes me a happy New
Year, and desires I would rise, for it is a good fire, and faith
&rsquo;tis cold.&nbsp; I was so politic last night with MD, never
saw the like.&nbsp; Get the <i>Examiners</i>, and read them; the
last nine or ten are full of the reasons for the late change, and
of the abuses of the last Ministry; and the great men assure me
they are all true.&nbsp; They are written by their encouragement
and direction.&nbsp; I must rise and go see Sir Andrew Fountaine;
but perhaps to-night I may answer MD&rsquo;s letter: so <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>good-morrow, my mistresses all, good-morrow.</p>
<blockquote><p>I wish you both a merry New Year,<br />
Roast beef, minced pies, and good strong beer,<br />
And me a share of your good cheer,<br />
That I was there, or you were here;<br />
And you&rsquo;re a little saucy dear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good-morrow again, dear sirrahs; one cannot rise for your
play.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I went this morning to visit Lady
Kerry and Lord Shelburne; and they made me dine with them.&nbsp;
Sir Andrew Fountaine is better.&nbsp; And now let us come and see
what this saucy, dear letter of MD says.&nbsp; Come out, letter,
come out from between the sheets; here it is underneath, and it
will not come out.&nbsp; Come out again, I say: so there.&nbsp;
Here it is.&nbsp; What says Presto to me, pray? says it.&nbsp;
Come, and let me answer for you to your ladies.&nbsp; Hold up
your head then, like a good letter.&nbsp; There.&nbsp; Pray, how
have you got up with Presto, Madam Stella?&nbsp; You write your
eighth when you receive mine: now I write my twelfth when I
receive your eighth.&nbsp; Do not you allow for what are upon the
road, simpleton?&nbsp; What say you to that?&nbsp; And so you
kept Presto&rsquo;s little birthday, I warrant: would to God I
had been at the health rather than here, where I have no manner
of pleasure, nothing but eternal business upon my hands.&nbsp; I
shall grow wise in time; but no more of that: only I say Amen
with my heart and vitals, that we may never be asunder again ten
days together while poor Presto
lives.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t be merry so near any splenetic talk; so I made that
long line, and now all&rsquo;s well again.&nbsp; Yes, you are a
pretending slut, indeed, with your fourth and fifth in the
margin, and your journal, and everything.&nbsp; Wind&mdash;we saw
no wind here, nothing at all extraordinary at any time.&nbsp; We
had it once when you had it not.&nbsp; But an old saying and a
true:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I hate all wind,<br />
Before and behind,<br />
From cheeks with eyes,<br />
Or from blind.&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your chimney fall down!&nbsp; God preserve you.&nbsp; I
suppose you only mean a brick or two: but that&rsquo;s a
d&mdash;ned lie of your chimney being carried to the next house
with the wind.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t put such things upon us; those
matters will not pass <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>here: keep a little to
possibilities.&nbsp; My Lord Hertford <a
name="citation112a"></a><a href="#footnote112a"
class="citation">[112a]</a> would have been ashamed of such a
stretch.&nbsp; You should take care of what company you converse
with: when one gets that faculty, &rsquo;tis hard to break
one&rsquo;s self of it.&nbsp; Jemmy Leigh talks of going over;
but <i>quando</i>?&nbsp; I do not know when he will go.&nbsp; Oh,
now you have had my ninth, now you are come up with me; marry
come up with you, indeed.&nbsp; I know all that business of Lady
S&mdash;. <a name="citation112b"></a><a href="#footnote112b"
class="citation">[112b]</a>&nbsp; Will nobody cut that
D&mdash;y&rsquo;s throat?&nbsp; Five hundred pounds do you call
poor pay for living three months the life of a king?&nbsp; They
say she died with grief, partly, being forced to appear as a
witness in court about some squabble among their
servants.&mdash;The Bishop of Clogher showed you a pamphlet. <a
name="citation112c"></a><a href="#footnote112c"
class="citation">[112c]</a>&nbsp; Well, but you must not give
your mind to believe those things; people will say
anything.&nbsp; The <i>Character</i> is here reckoned admirable,
but most of the facts are trifles.&nbsp; It was first printed
privately here; and then some bold cur ventured to do it
publicly, and sold two thousand in two days: who the author is
must remain uncertain.&nbsp; Do you pretend to know,
impudence?&nbsp; How durst you think so?&nbsp; Pox on your
Parliaments: the Archbishop has told me of it; but we do not
vouchsafe to know anything of it here.&nbsp; No, no, no more of
your giddiness yet; thank you, Stella, for asking after it; thank
you; God Almighty bless you for your kindness to poor
Presto.&nbsp; You write to Lady Giffard and your mother upon what
I advise when it is too late.&nbsp; But yet I fancy this bad news
will bring down stocks so low, that one might buy to great
advantage.&nbsp; I design to venture going to see your mother
some day when Lady Giffard is abroad.&nbsp; Well, keep your
Rathburn <a name="citation112d"></a><a href="#footnote112d"
class="citation">[112d]</a> and stuff.&nbsp; I thought he was to
pay in your money upon his houses to be flung down about the what
do you call it.&mdash;Well, Madam Dingley, I sent your enclosed
<a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>to
Bristol, but have not heard from Raymond since he went.&nbsp;
Come, come, young women, I keep a good fire; it costs me
twelvepence a week, and I fear something more; vex me, and I will
have one in my bed-chamber too.&nbsp; No, did not I tell you but
just now, we have no high winds here?&nbsp; Have you forgot
already?&mdash;Now you&rsquo;re at it again, silly Stella; why
does your mother say my candles are scandalous?&nbsp; They are
good sixes in the pound, and she said I was extravagant enough to
burn them by daylight.&nbsp; I never burn fewer at a time than
one.&nbsp; What would people have?&nbsp; The D&mdash; burst
Hawkshaw.&nbsp; He told me he had not the box; and the next day
Sterne told me he had sent it a fortnight ago.&nbsp; Patrick
could not find him t&rsquo;other day, but he shall
to-morrow.&nbsp; Dear life and heart, do you tease me? does
Stella tease Presto?&nbsp; That palsy-water was in the box; it
was too big for a packet, and I was afraid of its breaking.&nbsp;
Leigh was not in town then; or I would not have trusted it to
Sterne, whom yet I have befriended enough to do me more kindness
than that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never rest till you have it, or till
it is in a way for you to have it.&nbsp; Poor dear rogue, naughty
to think it teases me; how could I ever forgive myself for
neglecting anything that related to your health?&nbsp; Sure I
were a Devil if I did.
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
See how far I am forced to stand from Stella, because I am afraid
she thinks poor Presto has not been careful about her little
things; I am sure I bought them immediately according to order,
and packed them up with my own hands, and sent them to Sterne,
and was six times with him about sending them away.&nbsp; I am
glad you are pleased with your glasses.&nbsp; I have got another
velvet cap; a new one Lord Herbert <a name="citation113"></a><a
href="#footnote113" class="citation">[113]</a> bought and
presented me one morning I was at breakfast with him, where he
was as merry and easy as ever I saw him, yet had received a
challenge half an hour before, and half an hour after fought a
duel.&nbsp; It was about ten days ago.&nbsp; You <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>are
mistaken in your guesses about <i>Tatlers</i>: I did neither
write that on Noses nor Religion, <a name="citation114"></a><a
href="#footnote114" class="citation">[114]</a> nor do I send him
of late any hints at all.&mdash;Indeed, Stella, when I read your
letter, I was not uneasy at all; but when I came to answer the
particulars, and found that you had not received your box, it
grated me to the heart, because I thought, through your little
words, that you imagined I had not taken the care I ought.&nbsp;
But there has been some blunder in this matter, which I will know
to-morrow, and write to Sterne, for fear he should not be
within.&mdash;And pray, pray, Presto, pray now do.&mdash;No,
Raymond was not above four times with me while he stayed, and
then only while I was dressing.&nbsp; Mrs. Fenton has written me
another letter about some money of hers in Lady Giffard&rsquo;s
hands, that is entrusted to me by my mother, not to come to her
husband.&nbsp; I send my letters constantly every fortnight, and,
if you will have them oftener, you may, but then they will be the
shorter.&nbsp; Pray, let Parvisol sell the horse.&nbsp; I think I
spoke to you of it in a former letter: I am glad you are rid of
him, and was in pain while I thought you rode him; but, if he
would buy you another, or anybody else, and that you could be
often able to ride, why do not you do it?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I went this morning early to the Secretary of State,
Mr. St. John; and he told me from Mr. Harley that the warrant was
now drawn, in order for a patent for the First-Fruits: it must
pass through several offices, and take up some time, because in
things the Queen gives they are always considerate; but that, he
assures me, &rsquo;tis granted and done, and past all dispute,
and desires I will not be in any pain at all.&nbsp; I will write
again to the Archbishop to-morrow, and tell him this, and I
desire you will say it on occasion.&nbsp; From the Secretary I
went to Mr. Sterne, who said he would write to you to-night; and
that the box must be at Chester; and that some friend of his goes
very soon, and will carry it over.&nbsp; I dined with Mr.
Secretary St. John, and at six went to Darteneufs house to drink
punch with <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>him, and Mr. Addison, and little Harrison, <a
name="citation115a"></a><a href="#footnote115a"
class="citation">[115a]</a> a young poet, whose fortune I am
making.&nbsp; Steele was to have been there, but came not, nor
never did twice, since I knew him, to any appointment.&nbsp; I
stayed till past eleven, and am now in bed.&nbsp; Steele&rsquo;s
last <i>Tatler</i> came out to-day.&nbsp; You will see it before
this comes to you, and how he takes leave of the world.&nbsp; He
never told so much as Mr. Addison of it, who was surprised as
much as I; but, to say the truth, it was time, for he grew cruel
dull and dry.&nbsp; To my knowledge he had several good hints to
go upon; but he was so lazy and weary of the work that he would
not improve them.&nbsp; I think I will send this after <a
name="citation115b"></a><a href="#footnote115b"
class="citation">[115b]</a> to-morrow: shall I before &rsquo;tis
full, Dingley?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Lord Peterborow yesterday called me into a
barber&rsquo;s shop, and there we talked deep politics: he
desired me to dine with him to-day at the Globe in the Strand; he
said he would show me so clearly how to get Spain, that I could
not possibly doubt it.&nbsp; I went to-day accordingly, and saw
him among half a dozen lawyers and attorneys and hang-dogs,
signing of deeds and stuff before his journey; for he goes
to-morrow to Vienna.&nbsp; I sat among that scurvy company till
after four, but heard nothing of Spain; only I find, by what he
told me before, that he fears he shall do no good in his present
journey. <a name="citation115c"></a><a href="#footnote115c"
class="citation">[115c]</a>&nbsp; We are to be mighty constant
correspondents.&nbsp; So I took my leave of him, and called at
Sir Andrew Fountaine&rsquo;s, who mends much.&nbsp; I came home,
an&rsquo;t please you, at six, and have been studying till now
past eleven.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Morrow, little dears.&nbsp; O, faith,
I have been dreaming; I was to be put in prison.&nbsp; I do not
know why, and I was so afraid of a black dungeon; and then all I
had <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>been
inquiring yesterday of Sir Andrew Fountaine&rsquo;s sickness I
thought was of poor Stella.&nbsp; The worst of dreams is, that
one wakes just in the humour they leave one.&nbsp; Shall I send
this to-day?&nbsp; With all my heart: it is two days within the
fortnight; but may be MD are in haste to have a round dozen: and
then how are you come up to me with your eighth, young
women?&nbsp; But you indeed ought to write twice slower than I,
because there are two of you; I own that.&nbsp; Well then, I will
seal up this letter by my morning candle, and carry it into the
city with me, where I go to dine, and put it into the post-office
with my own fair hands.&nbsp; So, let me see whether I have any
news to tell MD.&nbsp; They say they will very soon make some
inquiries into the corruptions of the late Ministry; and they
must do it, to justify their turning them out.&nbsp; Atterbury,
<a name="citation116a"></a><a href="#footnote116a"
class="citation">[116a]</a> we think, is to be Dean of Christ
Church in Oxford; but the College would rather have
Smalridge&mdash;What&rsquo;s all this to you?&nbsp; What care you
for Atterburys and Smalridges?&nbsp; No, you care for nothing but
Presto, faith.&nbsp; So I will rise, and bid you farewell; yet I
am loth to do so, because there is a great bit of paper yet to
talk upon; but Dingley will have it so: &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says
she, &ldquo;make your journals shorter, and send them
oftener;&rdquo; and so I will.&nbsp; And I have cheated you
another way too; for this is clipped paper, and holds at least
six lines less than the former ones.&nbsp; I will tell you a good
thing I said to my Lord Carteret. <a name="citation116b"></a><a
href="#footnote116b" class="citation">[116b]</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;So,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;my Lord came up to me, and
asked me,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;my
Lord never did, nor ever can come up to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; We all
pun here sometimes.&nbsp; Lord Carteret set down Prior
t&rsquo;other day in his chariot; and Prior <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>thanked him
for his <i>charity</i>; that was fit for Dilly. <a
name="citation117a"></a><a href="#footnote117a"
class="citation">[117a]</a>&nbsp; I do not remember I heard one
good one from the Ministry; which is really a shame.&nbsp; Henley
is gone to the country for Christmas.&nbsp; The puppy comes here
without his wife, <a name="citation117b"></a><a
href="#footnote117b" class="citation">[117b]</a> and keeps no
house, and would have me dine with him at eating-houses; but I
have only done it once, and will do it no more.&nbsp; He had not
seen me for some time in the Coffee-house, and asking after me,
desired Lord Herbert to tell me I was a beast for ever, after the
order of Melchisedec.&nbsp; Did you ever read the Scripture? <a
name="citation117c"></a><a href="#footnote117c"
class="citation">[117c]</a>&nbsp; It is only changing the word
priest to beast.&mdash;I think I am bewitched, to write so much
in a morning to you, little MD.&nbsp; Let me go, will you? and
I&rsquo;ll come again to-night in a fine clean sheet of paper;
but I can nor will stay no longer now; no, I won&rsquo;t, for all
your wheedling: no, no, look off, do not smile at me, and say,
&ldquo;Pray, pray, Presto, write a little more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah!
you are a wheedling slut, you be so.&nbsp; Nay, but prithee turn
about, and let me go, do; &rsquo;tis a good girl, and do.&nbsp;
O, faith, my morning candle is just out, and I must go now in
spite of my teeth; for my bed-chamber is dark with curtains, and
I am at the wrong side.&nbsp; So farewell, etc. etc.</p>
<p>I am in the dark almost: I must have another candle, when I am
up, to seal this; but I will fold it up in the dark, and make
what you can of this, for I can only see this paper I am writing
upon.&nbsp; Service to Mrs. Walls and Mrs. Stoyte.</p>
<p>God Almighty bless you, etc.&nbsp; What I am doing I
can&rsquo;t see; but I will fold it up, and not look on it
again.</p>

118</span>LETTER XIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Jan.</i> 4, 1710&ndash;11.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> going into the City (where I
dined) and put my 12th, with my own fair hands, into the
post-office as I came back, which was not till nine this
night.&nbsp; I dined with people that you never heard of, nor is
it worth your while to know; an authoress and a printer. <a
name="citation118a"></a><a href="#footnote118a"
class="citation">[118a]</a>&nbsp; I walked home for exercise, and
at eleven got to bed; and, all the while I was undressing myself,
there was I speaking monkey things in air, just as if MD had been
by, and did not recollect myself till I got into bed.&nbsp; I
writ last night to the Archbishop, and told him the warrant was
drawn for the First-Fruits; and I told him Lord Peterborow was
set out for his journey to Vienna; but it seems the Lords have
addressed to have him stay, to be examined about Spanish affairs,
upon this defeat there, and to know where the fault lay,
etc.&nbsp; So I writ to the Archbishop a lie; but I think it was
not a sin.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary St. John sent for me this morning so
early, that I was forced to go without shaving, which put me
quite out of method.&nbsp; I called at Mr. Ford&rsquo;s, and
desired him to lend me a shaving; and so made a shift to get into
order again.&nbsp; Lord! here is an impertinence: Sir Andrew
Fountaine&rsquo;s mother and sister <a name="citation118b"></a><a
href="#footnote118b" class="citation">[118b]</a> are come above a
hundred miles, from Worcester, to see him before he died.&nbsp;
They got here but yesterday; and he must have been past hopes, or
past fears, before they could reach him.&nbsp; I fell a scolding
when I heard they were coming; and the people about him wondered
at me, and said what a mighty content it would be on both sides
to die when they were with him!&nbsp; I knew the mother; she is
the greatest Overdo <a name="citation118c"></a><a
href="#footnote118c" class="citation">[118c]</a> upon earth; and
the sister, they say, is worse; the poor man will relapse again
<a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>among
them.&nbsp; Here was the scoundrel brother always crying in the
outer room till Sir Andrew was in danger; and the dog was to have
all his estate if he died; and it is an ignorant, worthless,
scoundrel-rake: and the nurses were comforting him, and desiring
he would not take on so.&nbsp; I dined to-day the first time with
Ophy Butler <a name="citation119a"></a><a href="#footnote119a"
class="citation">[119a]</a> and his wife; and you supped with the
Dean, and lost two-and-twenty pence at cards.&nbsp; And so Mrs.
Walls is brought to bed of a girl, who died two days after it was
christened; and, betwixt you and me, she is not very sorry: she
loves her ease and diversions too well to be troubled with
children.&nbsp; I will go to bed.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I went last night to put some coals on
my fire after Patrick was gone to bed; and there I saw in a
closet a poor linnet he has bought to bring over to Dingley: it
cost him sixpence, and is as tame as a dormouse.&nbsp; I believe
he does not know he is a bird: where you put him, there he
stands, and seems to have neither hope nor fear; I suppose in a
week he will die of the spleen.&nbsp; Patrick advised with me
before he bought him.&nbsp; I laid fairly before him the
greatness of the sum, and the rashness of the attempt; showed how
impossible it was to carry him safe over the salt sea: but he
would not take my counsel; and he will repent it.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis very cold this morning in bed; and I hear there is a
good fire in the room without (what do you call it?), the
dining-room.&nbsp; I hope it will be good weather, and so let me
rise, sirrahs, do so.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I was this morning to
visit the Dean, <a name="citation119b"></a><a
href="#footnote119b" class="citation">[119b]</a> or Mr.
Prolocutor, I think you call him, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Why
should not I go to the Dean&rsquo;s as well as you?&nbsp; A
little, black man, of pretty near fifty?&nbsp; Ay, the
same.&nbsp; A good, pleasant man?&nbsp; Ay, the same.&nbsp;
Cunning enough?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; One that understands his own
interests?&nbsp; As well as anybody.&nbsp; How comes it MD and I
don&rsquo;t meet there sometimes?&nbsp; A very good face, and
abundance of wit?&nbsp; Do <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>you know his lady?&nbsp; O Lord!
whom do you mean? <a name="citation120a"></a><a
href="#footnote120a" class="citation">[120a]</a>&nbsp; I mean Dr.
Atterbury, Dean of Carlisle and Prolocutor.&nbsp; Pshaw, Presto,
you are a fool: I thought you had meant our Dean of St.
Patrick&rsquo;s.&mdash;Silly, silly, silly, you are silly, both
are silly, every kind of thing is silly.&nbsp; As I walked into
the city I was stopped with clusters of boys and wenches buzzing
about the cake-shops like flies. <a name="citation120b"></a><a
href="#footnote120b" class="citation">[120b]</a>&nbsp; There had
the fools let out their shops two yards forward into the streets,
all spread with great cakes frothed with sugar, and stuck with
streamers of tinsel.&nbsp; And then I went to Bateman&rsquo;s the
bookseller, and laid out eight-and-forty shillings for
books.&nbsp; I bought three little volumes of Lucian in French
for our Stella, and so and so.&nbsp; Then I went to
Garraway&rsquo;s <a name="citation120c"></a><a
href="#footnote120c" class="citation">[120c]</a> to meet
Stratford and dine with him; but it was an idle day with the
merchants, and he was gone to our end of the town: so I dined
with Sir Thomas Frankland at the Post Office, and we drank your
Manley&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; It was in a newspaper that he was
turned out; but Secretary St. John told me it was false: only
that newswriter is a plaguy Tory.&nbsp; I have not seen one bit
of Christmas merriment.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Your new Lord Chancellor <a
name="citation120d"></a><a href="#footnote120d"
class="citation">[120d]</a> sets out to-morrow for Ireland: I
never saw him.&nbsp; He carries over one Trapp <a
name="citation120e"></a><a href="#footnote120e"
class="citation">[120e]</a> a parson as his chaplain, a sort of
pretender to wit, a second-rate pamphleteer for the cause, whom
they pay by sending him to Ireland.&nbsp; I never saw Trapp
neither.&nbsp; I met Tighe <a name="citation120f"></a><a
href="#footnote120f" class="citation">[120f]</a> <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>and your
Smyth of Lovet&rsquo;s yesterday by the Exchange.&nbsp; Tighe and
I took no notice of each other; but I stopped Smyth, and told him
of the box that lies for you at Chester, because he says he goes
very soon to Ireland, I think this week: and I will send this
morning to Sterne, to take measures with Smyth; so good-morrow,
sirrahs, and let me rise, pray.&nbsp; I took up this paper when I
came in at evening, I mean this minute, and then said I,
&ldquo;No, no, indeed, MD, you must stay&rdquo;; and then was
laying it aside, but could not for my heart, though I am very
busy, till I just ask you how you do since morning; by and by we
shall talk more, so let me leave you: softly down, little paper,
till then; so there&mdash;now to business; there, I say, get you
gone; no, I will not push you neither, but hand you on one
side&mdash;So&mdash;Now I am got into bed, I&rsquo;ll talk with
you.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary St. John sent for me this morning in all
haste; but I would not lose my shaving, for fear of missing
church.&nbsp; I went to Court, which is of late always very full;
and young Manley and I dined at Sir Matthew
Dudley&rsquo;s.&mdash;I must talk politics.&nbsp; I protest I am
afraid we shall all be embroiled with parties.&nbsp; The Whigs,
now they are fallen, are the most malicious toads in the
world.&nbsp; We have had now a second misfortune, the loss of
several Virginia ships.&nbsp; I fear people will begin to think
that nothing thrives under this Ministry: and if the Ministry can
once be rendered odious to the people, the Parliament may be
chosen Whig or Tory as the Queen pleases.&nbsp; Then I think our
friends press a little too hard on the Duke of Marlborough.&nbsp;
The country members <a name="citation121"></a><a
href="#footnote121" class="citation">[121]</a> are violent to
have past faults inquired into, and they have reason; but I do
not observe the Ministry to be very fond of it.&nbsp; In my
opinion we have nothing to save us but a Peace; and I am sure we
cannot have such a one as we hoped; and then the Whigs will bawl
what they would have done had they continued in power.&nbsp; I
tell the Ministry this as much as I dare; and shall venture to
say a little more to them, especially about the Duke of
Marlborough, who, as the Whigs give out, will lay <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>down his
command; and I question whether ever any wise State laid aside a
general who had been successful nine years together, whom the
enemy so much dread, and his own soldiers cannot but believe must
always conquer; and you know that in war opinion is nine parts in
ten.&nbsp; The Ministry hear me always with appearance of regard,
and much kindness; but I doubt they let personal quarrels mingle
too much with their proceedings.&nbsp; Meantime, they seem to
value all this as nothing, and are as easy and merry as if they
had nothing in their hearts or upon their shoulders; like
physicians, who endeavour to cure, but feel no grief, whatever
the patient suffers.&mdash;Pshaw, what is all this?&nbsp; Do you
know one thing, that I find I can write politics to you much
easier than to anybody alive?&nbsp; But I swear my head is full;
and I wish I were at Laracor, with dear, charming MD, etc.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Methinks, young women, I have made a
great progress in four days, at the bottom of this side already,
and no letter yet come from MD (that word interlined is
morning).&nbsp; I find I have been writing State affairs to
MD.&nbsp; How do they relish it?&nbsp; Why, anything that comes
from Presto is welcome; though really, to confess the truth, if
they had their choice, not to disguise the matter, they had
rather, etc.&nbsp; Now, Presto, I must tell you, you grow silly,
says Stella.&nbsp; That is but one body&rsquo;s opinion,
madam.&nbsp; I promised to be with Mr. Secretary St. John this
morning; but I am lazy, and will not go, because I had a letter
from him yesterday, to desire I would dine there to-day.&nbsp; I
shall be chid; but what care I?&mdash;Here has been Mrs. South
with me, just come from Sir Andrew Fountaine, and going to
market.&nbsp; He is still in a fever, and may live or die.&nbsp;
His mother and sister are now come up, and in the house; so there
is a lurry. <a name="citation122"></a><a href="#footnote122"
class="citation">[122]</a>&nbsp; I gave Mrs. South half a pistole
for a New Year&rsquo;s gift.&nbsp; So good-morrow, dears both,
till anon.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; Lord! I have been with Mr.
Secretary from dinner till eight; and, <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>though I
drank wine and water, I am so hot!&nbsp; Lady Stanley <a
name="citation123a"></a><a href="#footnote123a"
class="citation">[123a]</a> came to visit Mrs. St. John, <a
name="citation123b"></a><a href="#footnote123b"
class="citation">[123b]</a> and sent up for me to make up a
quarrel with Mrs. St. John, whom I never yet saw; and do you
think that devil of a Secretary would let me go, but kept me by
main force, though I told him I was in love with his lady, and it
was a shame to keep back a lover, etc.?&nbsp; But all would not
do; so at last I was forced to break away, but never went up, it
was then too late; and here I am, and have a great deal to do
to-night, though it be nine o&rsquo;clock; but one must say
something to these naughty MD&rsquo;s, else there will be no
quiet.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; To-day Ford and I set apart to go into the City to
buy books; but we only had a scurvy dinner at an alehouse; and he
made me go to the tavern and drink Florence, four and sixpence a
flask; damned wine! so I spent my money, which I seldom do, and
passed an insipid day, and saw nobody, and it is now ten
o&rsquo;clock, and I have nothing to say, but that &rsquo;tis a
fortnight to-morrow since I had a letter from MD; but if I have
it time enough to answer here, &rsquo;tis well enough, otherwise
woe betide you, faith.&nbsp; I will go to the toyman&rsquo;s,
here just in Pall Mall, and he sells great hugeous battoons; <a
name="citation123c"></a><a href="#footnote123c"
class="citation">[123c]</a> yes, faith, and so he does.&nbsp;
Does not he, Dingley?&nbsp; Yes, faith.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t lose
your money this Christmas.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; I must go this morning to Mr. Secretary St.
John.&nbsp; I promised yesterday, but failed, so can&rsquo;t
write any more till night to poor, dear MD.&mdash;At night.&nbsp;
O, faith, Dingley.&nbsp; I had company in the morning, and could
not go where I <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>designed; and I had a basket from Raymond at Bristol,
with six bottles of wine and a pound of chocolate, and some
tobacco to snuff; and he writ under, the carriage was paid; but
he lied, or I am cheated, or there is a mistake; and he has
written to me so confusedly about some things, that Lucifer could
not understand him.&nbsp; This wine is to be drunk with
Harley&rsquo;s brother <a name="citation124a"></a><a
href="#footnote124a" class="citation">[124a]</a> and Sir Robert
Raymond, Solicitor-General, in order to recommend the Doctor to
your new Lord Chancellor, who left this place on Monday; and
Raymond says he is hasting to Chester, to go with him.&mdash;I
suppose he leaves his wife behind; for when he left London he had
no thoughts of stirring till summer.&nbsp; So I suppose he will
be with you before this.&nbsp; Ford came and desired I would dine
with him, because it was Opera-day; which I did, and sent excuses
to Lord Shelburne, who had invited me.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; I am setting up a new Tatler, little Harrison, <a
name="citation124b"></a><a href="#footnote124b"
class="citation">[124b]</a> whom I have mentioned to you.&nbsp;
Others have put him on it, and I encourage him; and he was with
me this morning and evening, showing me his first, which comes
out on Saturday.&nbsp; I doubt he will not succeed, for I do not
much approve his manner; but the scheme is Mr. Secretary St.
John&rsquo;s and mine, and would have done well enough in good
hands.&nbsp; I recommended him to a printer, <a
name="citation124c"></a><a href="#footnote124c"
class="citation">[124c]</a> whom I sent for, and settled the
matter between them this evening.&nbsp; Harrison has just left
me, and I am tired with correcting his trash.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; I was this morning upon some business with Mr.
Secretary St. John, and he made me promise to dine with him;
which otherwise I would have done with Mr. Harley, whom I have
not been with these ten days.&nbsp; I cannot but think they have
mighty difficulties upon them; yet I always <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>find them
as easy and disengaged as schoolboys on a holiday.&nbsp; Harley
has the procuring of five or six millions on his shoulders, and
the Whigs will not lend a groat; <a name="citation125a"></a><a
href="#footnote125a" class="citation">[125a]</a> which is the
only reason of the fall of stocks: for they are like Quakers and
fanatics, that will only deal among themselves, while all others
deal indifferently with them.&nbsp; Lady Marlborough offers, if
they will let her keep her employments, never to come into the
Queen&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; The Whigs say the Duke of
Marlborough will serve no more; but I hope and think
otherwise.&nbsp; I would to Heaven I were this minute with MD at
Dublin; for I am weary of politics, that give me such melancholy
prospects.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; O, faith, I had an ugly giddy fit last night in my
chamber, and I have got a new box of pills to take, and hope I
shall have no more this good while.&nbsp; I would not tell you
before, because it would vex you, little rogues; but now it is
over.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord Shelburne; and to-day little
Harrison&rsquo;s new <i>Tatler</i> came out: there is not much in
it, but I hope he will mend.&nbsp; You must understand that, upon
Steele&rsquo;s leaving off, there were two or three scrub
<i>Tatlers</i> <a name="citation125b"></a><a href="#footnote125b"
class="citation">[125b]</a> came out, and one of them holds on
still, and to-day it advertised against Harrison&rsquo;s; and so
there must be disputes which are genuine, like the strops for
razors. <a name="citation125c"></a><a href="#footnote125c"
class="citation">[125c]</a>&nbsp; I am afraid the little toad has
not the true vein for it.&nbsp; I will tell you a copy of
verses.&nbsp; When Mr. St. John was turned out from being
Secretary at War, three years ago, he retired to the country:
there he was talking of something he would have written over his
summer-house, and a gentleman gave him these verses&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>From business and the noisy world retired,<br />
Nor vexed by love, nor by ambition fired;<br />
Gently I wait the call of Charon&rsquo;s boat,<br />
Still drinking like a fish, and &mdash; like a stoat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>He
swore to me he could hardly bear the jest; for he pretended to
retire like a philosopher, though he was but twenty-eight years
old: and I believe the thing was true: for he had been a thorough
rake.&nbsp; I think the three grave lines do introduce the last
well enough.&nbsp; Od so, but I will go sleep; I sleep early
now.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; O, faith, young women, I want a letter from MD;
&rsquo;tis now nineteen days since I had the last: and where have
I room to answer it, pray?&nbsp; I hope I shall send this away
without any answer at all; for I&rsquo;ll hasten it, and away it
goes on Tuesday, by which time this side will be full.&nbsp; I
will send it two days sooner on purpose out of spite; and the
very next day after, you must know, your letter will come, and
then &rsquo;tis too late, and I will so laugh, never saw the
like!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis spring with us already.&nbsp; I ate
asparagus t&rsquo;other day.&nbsp; Did you ever see such a
frostless winter?&nbsp; Sir Andrew Fountaine lies still extremely
ill; it costs him ten guineas a day to doctors, surgeons, and
apothecaries, and has done so these three weeks.&nbsp; I dined
to-day with Mr. Ford; he sometimes chooses to dine at home, and I
am content to dine with him; and at night I called at the
Coffee-house, where I had not been in a week, and talked coldly a
while with Mr. Addison.&nbsp; All our friendship and dearness are
off: we are civil acquaintance, talk words of course, of when we
shall meet, and that is all.&nbsp; I have not been at any house
with him these six weeks: t&rsquo;other day we were to have dined
together at the Comptroller&rsquo;s; <a
name="citation126a"></a><a href="#footnote126a"
class="citation">[126a]</a> but I sent my excuses, being engaged
to the Secretary of State.&nbsp; Is not it odd?&nbsp; But I think
he has used me ill; and I have used him too well, at least his
friend Steele.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; It has cost me three guineas to-day for a periwig.
<a name="citation126b"></a><a href="#footnote126b"
class="citation">[126b]</a>&nbsp; I <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>am undone!&nbsp; It was made by a
Leicester lad, who married Mr. Worrall&rsquo;s daughter, where my
mother lodged; <a name="citation127a"></a><a href="#footnote127a"
class="citation">[127a]</a> so I thought it would be cheap, and
especially since he lives in the city.&nbsp; Well, London
lickpenny: <a name="citation127b"></a><a href="#footnote127b"
class="citation">[127b]</a>&nbsp; I find it true.&nbsp; I have
given Harrison hints for another <i>Tatler</i> to-morrow.&nbsp;
The jackanapes wants a right taste: I doubt he won&rsquo;t
do.&nbsp; I dined with my friend Lewis of the Secretary&rsquo;s
office, and am got home early, because I have much business to
do; but before I begin, I must needs say something to MD,
faith&mdash;No, faith, I lie, it is but nineteen days to-day
since my last from MD.&nbsp; I have got Mr. Harley to promise
that whatever changes are made in the Council, the Bishop of
Clogher shall not be removed, and he has got a memorial
accordingly.&nbsp; I will let the Bishop know so much in a post
or two.&nbsp; This is a secret; but I know he has enemies, and
they shall not be gratified, if they designed any such thing,
which perhaps they might; for some changes there will be
made.&nbsp; So drink up your claret, and be quiet, and do not
lose your money.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Faith, I will send this letter to-day
to shame you, if I han&rsquo;t one from MD before night,
that&rsquo;s certain.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you grumble for want of
the third side, pray now?&nbsp; Yes, I warrant you; yes, yes, you
shall have the third, you shall so, when you can catch it, some
other time; when you be writing girls.&mdash;O, faith, I think I
won&rsquo;t stay till night, but seal up this just now, and carry
it in my pocket, and whip it into the post-office as I come home
at evening.&nbsp; I am going out early this
morning.&mdash;Patrick&rsquo;s bills for coals and candles, etc.,
come sometimes to three shillings a week; I keep very good fires,
though the weather be warm.&nbsp; Ireland will never be happy
till you get <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>small coal <a name="citation128a"></a><a
href="#footnote128a" class="citation">[128a]</a> likewise;
nothing so easy, so convenient, so cheap, so pretty, for lighting
a fire.&nbsp; My service to Mrs. Stoyte and Walls; has she a boy
or a girl?&nbsp; A girl, hum; and died in a week, humm; and was
poor Stella forced to stand for godmother?&mdash;Let me know how
accompts stand, that you may have your money betimes.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s four months for my lodging, that must be thought on
too: and so go dine with Manley, and lose your money, do,
extravagant sluttikin, but don&rsquo;t fret.&mdash;It will be
just three weeks when I have the next letter, that&rsquo;s
to-morrow.&nbsp; Farewell, dearest beloved MD; and love poor,
poor Presto, who has not had one happy day since he left you, as
hope saved.&mdash;It is the last sally I will ever make, but I
hope it will turn to some account.&nbsp; I have done more for
these, <a name="citation128b"></a><a href="#footnote128b"
class="citation">[128b]</a> and I think they are more honest than
the last; however, I will not be disappointed.&nbsp; I would make
MD and me easy; and I never desired more.&mdash;Farewell, etc.
etc.</p>
<h3>LETTER XIV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Jan.</i> 16, 1710&ndash;11.</p>
<p>O <span class="smcap">faith</span>, young women, I have sent
my letter N. 13 without one crumb of an answer to any of
MD&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s for you now; and yet Presto ben&rsquo;t
angry, faith, not a bit, only he will begin to be in pain next
Irish post, except he sees MD&rsquo;s little handwriting in the
glass-frame at the bar of St. James&rsquo;s Coffee-house, where
Presto would never go but for that purpose.&nbsp; Presto is at
home, God help him, every night from six till bed-time, and has
as little enjoyment <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>or pleasure in life at present as
anybody in the world, although in full favour with all the
Ministry.&nbsp; As hope saved, nothing gives Presto any sort of
dream of happiness but a letter now and then from his own dearest
MD.&nbsp; I love the expectation of it; and when it does not
come, I comfort myself that I have it yet to be happy with.&nbsp;
Yes, faith, and when I write to MD, I am happy too; it is just as
if methinks you were here, and I prating to you, and telling you
where I have been: &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says you, &ldquo;Presto,
come, where have you been to-day? come, let&rsquo;s hear
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so then I answer: &ldquo;Ford and I were
visiting Mr. Lewis and Mr. Prior; and Prior has given me a fine
Plautus; and then Ford would have had me dine at his lodgings,
and so I would not; and so I dined with him at an eating-house,
which I have not done five times since I came here; and so I came
home, after visiting Sir Andrew Fountaine&rsquo;s mother and
sister, and Sir Andrew Fountaine is mending, though
slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; I was making, this morning, some general visits, and
at twelve I called at the Coffee-house for a letter from MD; so
the man said he had given it to Patrick.&nbsp; Then I went to the
Court of Requests and Treasury, to find Mr. Harley, and, after
some time spent in mutual reproaches, I promised to dine with
him.&nbsp; I stayed there till seven, then called at
Sterne&rsquo;s and Leigh&rsquo;s to talk about your box, and to
have it sent by Smyth.&nbsp; Sterne says he has been making
inquiries, and will set things right as soon as possible.&nbsp; I
suppose it lies at Chester, at least I hope so, and only wants a
lift over to you.&nbsp; Here has little Harrison been to complain
that the printer I recommended to him for his <i>Tatler</i> is a
coxcomb; and yet to see how things will happen; for this very
printer is my cousin, his name is Dryden Leach; <a
name="citation129a"></a><a href="#footnote129a"
class="citation">[129a]</a> did you never hear of Dryden Leach,
he that prints the <i>Postman</i>?&nbsp; He acted Oroonoko; <a
name="citation129b"></a><a href="#footnote129b"
class="citation">[129b]</a> he&rsquo;s in love with Miss Cross.
<a name="citation129c"></a><a href="#footnote129c"
class="citation">[129c]</a>&mdash;Well, so I came <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>home to
read my letter from Stella, but the dog Patrick was abroad; at
last he came, and I got my letter.&nbsp; I found another hand had
superscribed it; when I opened it, I found it written all in
French, and subscribed Bernage: <a name="citation130a"></a><a
href="#footnote130a" class="citation">[130a]</a> faith, I was
ready to fling it at Patrick&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Bernage tells me
he had been to desire your recommendation to me, to make him a
captain; and your cautious answer, that he had as much power with
me as you, was a notable one; if you were here, I would present
you to the Ministry as a person of ability.&nbsp; Bernage should
let me know where to write to him; this is the second letter I
have had without any direction; however, I beg I may not have a
third, but that you will ask him, and send me how I shall direct
to him.&nbsp; In the meantime, tell him that if regiments are to
be raised here, as he says, I will speak to George Granville, <a
name="citation130b"></a><a href="#footnote130b"
class="citation">[130b]</a> Secretary at War, to make him a
captain; and use what other interest I conveniently can.&nbsp; I
think that is enough, and so tell him, and do not trouble me with
his letters, when I expect them from MD; do you hear, young
women? write to Presto.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; I was this morning with Mr. Secretary St. John, and
we were to dine at Mr. Harley&rsquo;s alone, about some business
of importance; but there were two or three gentlemen there.&nbsp;
Mr. Secretary and I went together from his office to Mr.
Harley&rsquo;s, and thought to have been very wise; but the deuce
a bit, the company stayed, and more came, and Harley went away at
seven, and the Secretary and I stayed with the rest of the
company till eleven; I would then have had him come away; but he
was in for&rsquo;t; and though he swore he would come away at
that flask, there I left him.&nbsp; I wonder at the civility of
these people; when he saw I would drink no more, he would always
pass the bottle by me, and yet I could not keep the toad from
drinking himself, nor he would not let <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>me go
neither, nor Masham, <a name="citation131a"></a><a
href="#footnote131a" class="citation">[131a]</a> who was with
us.&nbsp; When I got home, I found a parcel directed to me; and
opening it, I found a pamphlet written entirely against myself,
not by name, but against something I writ: <a
name="citation131b"></a><a href="#footnote131b"
class="citation">[131b]</a> it is pretty civil, and affects to be
so, and I think I will take no notice of it; &rsquo;tis against
something written very lately; and indeed I know not what to say,
nor do I care.&nbsp; And so you are a saucy rogue for losing your
money to-day at Stoyte&rsquo;s; to let that bungler beat you,
fie, Stella, an&rsquo;t you ashamed?&nbsp; Well, I forgive you
this once, never do so again; no, noooo.&nbsp; Kiss and be
friends, sirrah.&mdash;Come, let me go sleep, I go earlier to bed
than formerly; and have not been out so late these two months;
but the Secretary was in a drinking humour.&nbsp; So good-night,
myownlittledearsaucyinsolentrogues.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; Then you read that long word in the last line; no,
<a name="citation131c"></a><a href="#footnote131c"
class="citation">[131c]</a> faith, han&rsquo;t you.&nbsp; Well,
when will this letter come from our MD? to-morrow or next day
without fail; yes, faith, and so it is coming.&nbsp; This was an
insipid snowy day, no walking day, and I dined gravely with Mrs.
Vanhomrigh, and came home, and am now got to bed a little after
ten; I remember old Culpepper&rsquo;s maxim:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Would you have a settled head,<br />
You must early go to bed:<br />
I tell you, and I tell&rsquo;t again,<br />
You must be in bed at ten.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>20.&nbsp; And so I went to-day with my new wig, o hoao, to <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>visit Lady
Worsley, <a name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132"
class="citation">[132]</a> whom I had not seen before, although
she was near a month in town.&nbsp; Then I walked in the Park to
find Mr. Ford, whom I had promised to meet; and coming down the
Mall, who should come towards me but Patrick, and gives me five
letters out of his pocket.&nbsp; I read the superscription of the
first, &ldquo;Pshoh,&rdquo; said I; of the second,
&ldquo;Pshoh&rdquo; again; of the third, &ldquo;Pshah, pshah,
pshah&rdquo;; of the fourth, &ldquo;A gad, a gad, a gad,
I&rsquo;m in a rage&rdquo;; of the fifth and last, &ldquo;O
hoooa; ay marry this is something, this is our MD&rdquo;; so
truly we opened it, I think immediately, and it began the most
impudently in the world, thus: &ldquo;Dear Presto, We are even
thus far.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now we are even,&rdquo; quoth
Stephen, when he gave his wife six blows for one.&nbsp; I
received your ninth four days after I had sent my
thirteenth.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll reckon with you anon about that,
young women.&nbsp; Why did not you recant at the end of your
letter, when you got my eleventh, tell me that, huzzies base?
were we even then, were we, sirrah?&nbsp; But I won&rsquo;t
answer your letter now, I&rsquo;ll keep it for another
time.&nbsp; We had a great deal of snow to-day, and &rsquo;tis
terrible cold.&nbsp; I dined with Ford, because it was his
Opera-day and snowed, so I did not care to stir farther.&nbsp; I
will send to-morrow to Smyth.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; It has snowed terribly all night, and
is vengeance cold.&nbsp; I am not yet up, but cannot write long;
my hands will freeze.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there a good fire,
Patrick?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I
will rise; come, take away the candle.&rdquo;&nbsp; You must know
I write on the dark side of my bed-chamber, and am forced to have
a candle till I rise, for the bed stands between me and the
window, and I keep the curtains shut this cold weather.&nbsp; So
pray let me rise; and Patrick, here, take away the
candle.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; We are now here in <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>high frost
and snow, the largest fire can hardly keep us warm.&nbsp; It is
very ugly walking; a baker&rsquo;s boy broke his thigh
yesterday.&nbsp; I walk slow, make short steps, and never tread
on my heel.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a good proverb the Devonshire people
have:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Walk
fast in snow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In frost walk slow;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And still as you go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tread on your toe.<br />
When frost and snow are both together,<br />
Sit by the fire, and spare shoe-leather.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I dined to-day with Dr. Cockburn, <a
name="citation133a"></a><a href="#footnote133a"
class="citation">[133a]</a> but will not do so again in haste, he
has generally such a parcel of Scots with him.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Starving, starving, uth, uth, uth,
uth, uth.&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you remember I used to come into your
chamber, and turn Stella out of her chair, and rake up the fire
in a cold morning, and cry Uth, uth, uth? etc.&nbsp; O, faith, I
must rise, my hand is so cold I can write no more.&nbsp; So
good-morrow, sirrahs.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I went this morning
to Lady Giffard&rsquo;s house, and saw your mother, and made her
give me a pint bottle of palsy-water, <a
name="citation133b"></a><a href="#footnote133b"
class="citation">[133b]</a> which I brought home in my pocket;
and sealed and tied up in a paper, and sent it to Mr. Smyth, who
goes to-morrow for Ireland, and sent a letter to him to desire
his care of it, and that he would inquire at Chester about the
box.&nbsp; He was not within: so the bottle and letter were left
for him at his lodgings, with strict orders to give them to him;
and I will send Patrick in a day or two, to know whether it was
given, etc.&nbsp; Dr. Stratford <a name="citation133c"></a><a
href="#footnote133c" class="citation">[133c]</a> and I dined
to-day with Mr. Stratford <a name="citation133d"></a><a
href="#footnote133d" class="citation">[133d]</a> in the City, by
appointment; but I chose to walk there, for exercise in the
frost.&nbsp; But the weather had given a little, as you women
call it, so it was something slobbery.&nbsp; I did not get home
till nine.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now I&rsquo;m in bed,<br />
To break your head.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>23.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; They tell me it freezes again,
but it is not so cold as yesterday: so now I will answer a bit of
your letter.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; O, faith, I was just going to
answer some of our MD&rsquo;s letter this morning, when a printer
came in about some business, and stayed an hour; so I rose, and
then came in Ben Tooke, and then I shaved and scribbled; and it
was such a terrible day, I could not stir out till one, and then
I called at Mrs. Barton&rsquo;s, and we went to Lady
Worsley&rsquo;s, where we were to dine by appointment.&nbsp; The
Earl of Berkeley <a name="citation134a"></a><a
href="#footnote134a" class="citation">[134a]</a> is going to be
married to Lady Louisa Lennox, the Duke of Richmond&rsquo;s
daughter.&nbsp; I writ this night to Dean Sterne, and bid him
tell you all about the bottle of palsy-water by Smyth; and
to-morrow morning I will say something to your letter.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Come now to your letter.&nbsp; As for
your being even with me, I have spoken to that already.&nbsp; So
now, my dearly beloved, let us proceed to the next.&nbsp; You are
always grumbling that you han&rsquo;t letters fast enough;
&ldquo;surely we shall have your tenth;&rdquo; and yet, before
you end your letter, you own you have my eleventh.&mdash;And why
did not MD go into the country with the Bishop of Clogher? faith,
such a journey would have done you good; Stella should have rode,
and Dingley gone in the coach.&nbsp; The Bishop of Kilmore <a
name="citation134b"></a><a href="#footnote134b"
class="citation">[134b]</a> I know nothing of; he is old, and may
die; he lives in some obscure corner, for I never heard of
him.&nbsp; As for my old friends, if you mean the Whigs, I never
see them, as you may find by my journals, except Lord Halifax,
and him very seldom; Lord Somers never since the first visit, for
he has been a false, deceitful rascal. <a
name="citation134c"></a><a href="#footnote134c"
class="citation">[134c]</a>&nbsp; My new friends are very kind,
and I have promises enough, but I do not count <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>upon them,
and besides my pretences are very young to them.&nbsp; However,
we will see what may be done; and if nothing at all, I shall not
be disappointed; although perhaps poor MD may, and then I shall
be sorrier for their sakes than my own.&mdash;Talk of a merry
Christmas (why do you write it so then, young women? sauce for
the goose is sauce for the gander), I have wished you all that
two or three letters ago.&nbsp; Good lack; and your news, that
Mr. St. John is going to Holland; he has no such thoughts, to
quit the great station he is in; nor, if he had, could I be
spared to go with him.&nbsp; So, faith, politic Madam Stella, you
come with your two eggs a penny, etc.&nbsp; Well, Madam Dingley,
and so Mrs. Stoyte invites you, and so you stay at Donnybrook,
and so you could not write.&nbsp; You are plaguy exact in your
journals, from Dec. 25 to Jan. 4.&nbsp; Well, Smyth and the
palsy-water I have handled already, and he does not lodge (or
rather did not, for, poor man, now he is gone) at Mr.
Jesse&rsquo;s, and all that stuff; but we found his lodging, and
I went to Stella&rsquo;s mother on my own head, for I never
remembered it was in the letter to desire another bottle; but I
was so fretted, so tosticated, and so impatient that Stella
should have her water (I mean decently, do not be rogues), and so
vexed with Sterne&rsquo;s carelessness.&mdash;Pray God,
Stella&rsquo;s illness may not return!&nbsp; If they come seldom,
they begin to be weary; I judge by myself; for when I seldom
visit, I grow weary of my acquaintance.&mdash;Leave a good deal
of my tenth unanswered!&nbsp; Impudent slut, when did you ever
answer my tenth, or ninth, or any other number? or who desires
you to answer, provided you write?&nbsp; I defy the D&mdash; to
answer my letters: sometimes there may be one or two things I
should be glad you would answer; but I forget them, and you never
think of them.&nbsp; I shall never love answering letters again,
if you talk of answering.&nbsp; Answering, quotha! pretty
answerers truly.&mdash;As for the pamphlet you speak of, and call
it scandalous, and that one Mr. Presto is said to write it, hear
my answer.&nbsp; Fie, child, you must not mind what every idle
body tells you&mdash;I believe you lie, and that the dogs were
not crying it when <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>you said so; come, tell truth.&nbsp; I am sorry you go
to St. Mary&rsquo;s <a name="citation136"></a><a
href="#footnote136" class="citation">[136]</a> so soon, you will
be as poor as rats; that place will drain you with a vengeance:
besides, I would have you think of being in the country in
summer.&nbsp; Indeed, Stella, pippins produced plentifully;
Parvisol could not send from Laracor: there were about half a
score, I would be glad to know whether they were good for
anything.&mdash;Mrs. Walls at Donnybrook with you; why is not she
brought to bed?&nbsp; Well, well, well, Dingley, pray be
satisfied; you talk as if you were angry about the Bishop&rsquo;s
not offering you conveniences for the journey; and so he
should.&mdash;What sort of Christmas?&nbsp; Why, I have had no
Christmas at all; and has it really been Christmas of late?&nbsp;
I never once thought of it.&nbsp; My service to Mrs. Stoyte, and
Catherine; and let Catherine get the coffee ready against I come,
and not have so much care on her countenance; for all will go
well.&mdash;Mr. Bernage, Mr. Bernage, Mr. Fiddlenage, I have had
three letters from him now successively; he sends no directions,
and how the D&mdash; shall I write to him?&nbsp; I would have
burnt his last, if I had not seen Stella&rsquo;s hand at the
bottom: his request is all nonsense.&nbsp; How can I assist him
in buying? and if he be ordered to go to Spain, go he must, or
else sell, and I believe one can hardly sell in such a
juncture.&nbsp; If he had stayed, and new regiments raised, I
would have used my endeavour to have had him removed; although I
have no credit that way, or very little: but, if the regiment
goes, he ought to go too; he has had great indulgence, and
opportunities of saving; and I have urged him to it a hundred
times.&nbsp; What can I do? whenever it lies in my power to do
him a good office, I will do it.&nbsp; Pray draw up this into a
handsome speech, and represent it to him from me, and that I
would write, if I knew where to direct to him; and so I have told
you, and desired you would tell him, fifty times.&nbsp; Yes,
Madam Stella, I think I can read your long concluding word, but
you can&rsquo;t read mine after bidding you good-night.&nbsp; And
yet methinks, I mend extremely in my writing; but when
Stella&rsquo;s eyes are <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>well, I hope to write as bad as
ever.&mdash;So now I have answered your letter, and mine is an
answer; for I lay yours before me, and I look and write, and
write and look, and look and write again.&mdash;So good-morrow,
madams both, and I will go rise, for I must rise; for I take
pills at night, and so I must rise early, I don&rsquo;t know
why.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I did not tell you how I passed my
time yesterday, nor bid you good-night, and there was good
reason.&nbsp; I went in the morning to Secretary St. John about
some business; he had got a great Whig with him; a creature of
the Duke of Marlborough, who is a go-between to make peace
between the Duke and the Ministry: so he came out of his closet,
and, after a few words, desired I would dine with him at three;
but Mr. Lewis stayed till six before he came; and there we sat
talking, and the time slipped so, that at last, when I was
positive to go, it was past two o&rsquo;clock; so I came home,
and went straight to bed.&nbsp; He would never let me look at his
watch, and I could not imagine it above twelve when we went
away.&nbsp; So I bid you good-night for last night, and now I bid
you good-morrow, and I am still in bed, though it be near ten,
but I must rise.</p>
<p>26, 27, 28, 29, 30.&nbsp; I have been so lazy and negligent
these last four days that I could not write to MD.&nbsp; My head
is not in order, and yet is not absolutely ill, but giddyish, and
makes me listless; I walk every day, and take drops of Dr.
Cockburn, and I have just done a box of pills; and to-day Lady
Kerry sent me some of her bitter drink, which I design to take
twice a day, and hope I shall grow better.&nbsp; I wish I were
with MD; I long for spring and good weather, and then I will come
over.&nbsp; My riding in Ireland keeps me well.&nbsp; I am very
temperate, and eat of the easiest meats as I am directed, and
hope the malignity will go off; but one fit shakes me a long
time.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord Mountjoy, yesterday at Mr.
Stone&rsquo;s, in the City, on Sunday at Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s,
Saturday with Ford, and Friday I think at Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s; and
that is all the journal I can send MD, for I was so lazy while I
was well, that I could not write.&nbsp; I thought to have sent
this <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>to-night, but &rsquo;tis ten, and I&rsquo;ll go to bed,
and write on t&rsquo;other side to Parvisol to-morrow, and send
it on Thursday; and so good-night, my dears; and love Presto, and
be healthy, and Presto will be so too, etc.</p>
<p>Cut off these notes handsomely, d&rsquo;ye hear, sirrahs, and
give Mrs. Brent hers, and keep yours till you see Parvisol, and
then make up the letter to him, and send it him by the first
opportunity; and so God Almighty bless you both, here and ever,
and poor Presto.</p>
<p>What, I warrant you thought at first that these last lines
were another letter.</p>
<p>Dingley, Pray pay Stella six fishes, and place them to the
account of your humble servant, Presto.</p>
<p>Stella, Pray pay Dingley six fishes, and place them to the
account of your humble servant, Presto.</p>
<p>There are bills of exchange for you.</p>
<h3>LETTER XV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Jan.</i> 31, 1710&ndash;11.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> to send you my fourteenth
to-morrow; but my head, having some little disorders, confounds
all my journals.&nbsp; I was early this morning with Mr.
Secretary St. John about some business, so I could not scribble
my morning lines to MD.&nbsp; They are here intending to tax all
little printed penny papers a halfpenny every half-sheet, which
will utterly ruin Grub Street, and I am endeavouring to prevent
it. <a name="citation138a"></a><a href="#footnote138a"
class="citation">[138a]</a>&nbsp; Besides, I was forwarding an
impeachment against a certain great person; that was two of my
businesses with the Secretary, were they not worthy ones?&nbsp;
It was Ford&rsquo;s birthday, and I refused the Secretary, and
dined with Ford.&nbsp; We are here in as smart a frost for the
time as I have seen; delicate walking weather, and the Canal and
Rosamond&rsquo;s Pond <a name="citation138b"></a><a
href="#footnote138b" class="citation">[138b]</a> full of the <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>rabble
sliding and with skates, if you know what those are.&nbsp;
Patrick&rsquo;s bird&rsquo;s water freezes in the gallipot, and
my hands in bed.</p>
<p>Feb. 1.&nbsp; I was this morning with poor Lady Kerry, who is
much worse in her head than I.&nbsp; She sends me bottles of her
bitter; and we are so fond of one another, because our ailments
are the same; don&rsquo;t you know that, Madam Stella?&nbsp;
Han&rsquo;t I seen you conning ailments with Joe&rsquo;s wife, <a
name="citation139a"></a><a href="#footnote139a"
class="citation">[139a]</a> and some others, sirrah?&nbsp; I
walked into the City to dine, because of the walk, for we must
take care of Presto&rsquo;s health, you know, because of poor
little MD.&nbsp; But I walked plaguy carefully, for fear of
sliding against my will; but I am very busy.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; This morning Mr. Ford came to me to walk into the
City, where he had business, and then to buy books at
Bateman&rsquo;s; and I laid out one pound five shillings for a
Strabo and Aristophanes, and I have now got books enough to make
me another shelf, and I will have more, or it shall cost me a
fall; and so as we came back, we drank a flask of right French
wine at Ben Tooke&rsquo;s chamber; and when I got home, Mrs.
Vanhomrigh sent me word her eldest daughter <a
name="citation139b"></a><a href="#footnote139b"
class="citation">[139b]</a> was taken suddenly very ill, and
desired I would come and see her.&nbsp; I went, and found it was
a silly trick of Mrs. Armstrong, <a name="citation139c"></a><a
href="#footnote139c" class="citation">[139c]</a> Lady
Lucy&rsquo;s sister, who, with Moll Stanhope, was visiting there:
however, I rattled off the daughter.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; To-day I went and dined at Lady Lucy&rsquo;s, where
you know I have not been this long time.&nbsp; They are plaguy
Whigs, especially the sister Armstrong, the most insupportable of
all women, pretending to wit, without any taste.&nbsp; She was
running down the last <i>Examiner</i>, <a
name="citation139d"></a><a href="#footnote139d"
class="citation">[139d]</a> the prettiest I had read, with a
character of the present Ministry.&mdash;I left them at five, and
came home.&nbsp; But I forgot to tell you, that this morning <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>my cousin
Dryden Leach, the printer, came to me with a heavy complaint,
that Harrison the new Tatler had turned him off, and taken the
last Tatler&rsquo;s printers again.&nbsp; He vowed revenge; I
answered gravely, and so he left me, and I have ordered Patrick
to deny me to him from henceforth: and at night comes a letter
from Harrison, telling me the same thing, and excused his doing
it without my notice, because he would bear all the blame; and in
his <i>Tatler</i> of this day <a name="citation140a"></a><a
href="#footnote140a" class="citation">[140a]</a> he tells you the
story, how he has taken his old officers, and there is a most
humble letter from Morphew and Lillie to beg his pardon, etc. <a
name="citation140b"></a><a href="#footnote140b"
class="citation">[140b]</a>&nbsp; And lastly, this morning Ford
sent me two letters from the Coffee-house (where I hardly ever
go), one from the Archbishop of Dublin, and t&rsquo;other
from&mdash;Who do you think t&rsquo;other was
from?&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you, because you are friends; why,
then it was, faith, it was from my own dear little MD, N.
10.&nbsp; Oh, but will not answer it now, no, noooooh, I&rsquo;ll
keep it between the two sheets; here it is, just under; oh, I
lifted up the sheet and saw it there: lie still, you shan&rsquo;t
be answered yet, little letter; for I must go to bed, and take
care of my head.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I avoid going to church yet, for fear of my head,
though it has been much better these last five or six days, since
I have taken Lady Kerry&rsquo;s bitter.&nbsp; Our frost holds
like a dragon.&nbsp; I went to Mr. Addison&rsquo;s, and dined
with him at his lodgings; I had not seen him these three weeks,
we are grown common acquaintance; yet what have not I done for
his friend Steele?&nbsp; Mr. Harley reproached me the last time I
saw him, that to please me he would be reconciled to Steele, and
had promised and appointed to see him, and that Steele never
came.&nbsp; Harrison, whom Mr. Addison recommended to me, I have
introduced to the Secretary of State, who has promised me to take
care of him; and I have represented Addison himself so to the
Ministry, that they think and talk in his favour, though they
hated him before.&mdash;Well, he is now in my debt, and
there&rsquo;s an end; and I never had the least obligation to
him, and there&rsquo;s <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>another end.&nbsp; This evening I
had a message from Mr. Harley, desiring to know whether I was
alive, and that I would dine with him to-morrow.&nbsp; They dine
so late, that since my head has been wrong I have avoided being
with them.&mdash;Patrick has been out of favour these ten days; I
talk dry and cross to him, and have called him
&ldquo;friend&rdquo; three or four times.&nbsp; But, sirrahs, get
you gone.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I am going this morning to see Prior,
who dines with me at Mr. Harley&rsquo;s; so I can&rsquo;t stay
fiddling and talking with dear little brats in a morning, and
&rsquo;tis still terribly cold.&mdash;I wish my cold hand was in
the warmest place about you, young women, I&rsquo;d give ten
guineas upon that account with all my heart, faith; oh, it
starves my thigh; so I&rsquo;ll rise and bid you good-morrow, my
ladies both, good-morrow.&nbsp; Come, stand away, let me rise:
Patrick, take away the candle.&nbsp; Is there a good
fire?&mdash;So&mdash;up-a-dazy.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; Mr. Harley
did not sit down till six, and I stayed till eleven; henceforth I
will choose to visit him in the evenings, and dine with him no
more if I can help it.&nbsp; It breaks all my measures, and hurts
my health; my head is disorderly, but not ill, and I hope it will
mend.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Here has been such a hurry with the Queen&rsquo;s
Birthday, so much fine clothes, and the Court so crowded that I
did not go there.&nbsp; All the frost is gone.&nbsp; It thawed on
Sunday, and so continues, yet ice is still on the Canal (I did
not mean that of Laracor, but St. James&rsquo;s Park) and boys
sliding on it.&nbsp; Mr. Ford pressed me to dine with him in his
chamber.&mdash;Did not I tell you Patrick has got a bird, a
linnet, to carry over to Dingley?&nbsp; It was very tame at
first, and &rsquo;tis now the wildest I ever saw.&nbsp; He keeps
it in a closet, where it makes a terrible litter; but I say
nothing: I am as tame as a clout.&nbsp; When must we answer our
MD&rsquo;s letter?&nbsp; One of these odd-come-shortlies.&nbsp;
This is a week old, you see, and no farther yet.&nbsp; Mr. Harley
desired I would dine with him again to-day; but I refused him,
for I fell out with him yesterday, <a name="citation141"></a><a
href="#footnote141" class="citation">[141]</a> <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>and will
not see him again till he makes me amends: and so I go to
bed.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; I was this morning early with Mr. Lewis of the
Secretary&rsquo;s office, and saw a letter Mr. Harley had sent to
him, desiring to be reconciled; but I was deaf to all entreaties,
and have desired Lewis to go to him, and let him know I expect
further satisfaction.&nbsp; If we let these great Ministers
pretend too much, there will be no governing them.&nbsp; He
promises to make me easy, if I will but come and see him; but I
won&rsquo;t, and he shall do it by message, or I will cast him
off.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you the cause of our quarrel when I
see you, and refer it to yourselves.&nbsp; In that he did
something, which he intended for a favour; and I have taken it
quite otherwise, disliking both the thing and the manner, and it
has heartily vexed me, and all I have said is truth, though it
looks like jest; and I absolutely refused to submit to his
intended favour, and expect further satisfaction.&nbsp; Mr. Ford
and I dined with Mr. Lewis.&nbsp; We have a monstrous deal of
snow, and it has cost me two shillings to-day in chair and coach,
and walked till I was dirty besides.&nbsp; I know not what it is
now to read or write after I am in bed.&nbsp; The last thing I do
up is to write something to our MD, and then get into bed, and
put out my candle, and so go sleep as fast as ever I can.&nbsp;
But in the mornings I do write sometimes in bed, as you know.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; <i>I have desired Apronia to be always
careful</i>, <i>especially about the legs</i>.&nbsp; Pray, do you
see any such great wit in that sentence?&nbsp; I must freely own
that I do not.&nbsp; But party carries everything nowadays, and
what a splutter have I heard about the wit of that saying,
repeated with admiration above a hundred times in half an
hour!&nbsp; Pray read it over again this moment, and consider
it.&nbsp; I think the word is <i>advised</i>, and not
<i>desired</i>.&nbsp; I should not have remembered it if I had
not heard it so often.&nbsp; Why&mdash;ay&mdash;You must know I
dreamed it just now, and waked with it in my mouth.&nbsp; Are you
bit, or are you not, sirrahs?&nbsp; I met Mr. Harley in the Court
of Requests, and he asked me <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>how long I had learnt the trick of
writing to myself?&nbsp; He had seen your letter through the
glass case at the Coffee-house, and would swear it was my hand;
and Mr. Ford, who took and sent it me, was of the same
mind.&nbsp; I remember others have formerly said so too.&nbsp; I
think I was little MD&rsquo;s writing-master. <a
name="citation143"></a><a href="#footnote143"
class="citation">[143]</a>&mdash;But come, what is here to do,
writing to young women in a morning?&nbsp; I have other fish to
fry; so good-morrow, my ladies all, good-morrow.&nbsp; Perhaps
I&rsquo;ll answer your letter to-night, perhaps I won&rsquo;t;
that&rsquo;s as saucy little Presto takes the humour.&mdash;At
night.&nbsp; I walked in the Park to-day in spite of the weather,
as I do always when it does not actually rain.&nbsp; Do you know
what it has gone and done?&nbsp; We had a thaw for three days,
then a monstrous dirt and snow, and now it freezes, like a
pot-lid, upon our snow.&nbsp; I dined with Lady Betty Germaine,
the first time since I came for England; and there did I sit,
like a booby, till eight, looking over her and another lady at
piquet, when I had other business enough to do.&nbsp; It was the
coldest day I felt this year.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; After I had been abed an hour last
night, I was forced to rise and call to the landlady and maid to
have the fire removed in a chimney below stairs, which made my
bed-chamber smoke, though I had no fire in it.&nbsp; I have been
twice served so.&nbsp; I never lay so miserable an hour in my
life.&nbsp; Is it not plaguy vexatious?&mdash;It has snowed all
night, and rains this morning.&mdash;Come, where&rsquo;s
MD&rsquo;s letter?&nbsp; Come, Mrs. Letter, make your
appearance.&nbsp; Here am I, says she, answer me to my
face.&mdash;O, faith, I am sorry you had my twelfth so soon; I
doubt you will stay longer for the rest.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so
&rsquo;fraid you have got my fourteenth while I am writing this;
and I would always have one letter from Presto reading, one
travelling, and one writing.&nbsp; As for the box, I now believe
it lost.&nbsp; It is directed for Mr. Curry, at his house in
Capel Street, etc.&nbsp; I had a letter yesterday from Dr.
Raymond in Chester, who says he sent his man everywhere, and
cannot find it; and <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>God knows whether Mr. Smyth will
have better success.&nbsp; Sterne spoke to him, and I writ to him
with the bottle of palsy-water; that bottle, I hope, will not
miscarry: I long to hear you have it.&nbsp; O, faith, you have
too good an opinion of Presto&rsquo;s care.&nbsp; I am negligent
enough of everything but MD, and I should not have trusted
Sterne.&mdash;But it shall not go so: I will have one more tug
for it.&mdash;As to what you say of Goodman Peasly and Isaac, <a
name="citation144a"></a><a href="#footnote144a"
class="citation">[144a]</a> I answer as I did before.&nbsp; Fie,
child, you must not give yourself the way to believe any such
thing: and afterwards, only for curiosity, you may tell me how
these things are approved, and how you like them; and whether
they instruct you in the present course of affairs, and whether
they are printed in your town, or only sent from hence.&mdash;Sir
Andrew Fountaine is recovered; so take your sorrow again, but
don&rsquo;t keep it, fling it to the dogs.&nbsp; And does little
MD walk indeed?&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad of it at heart.&mdash;Yes,
we have done with the plague here: it was very saucy in you to
pretend to have it before your betters.&nbsp; Your intelligence
that the story is false about the officers forced to sell, <a
name="citation144b"></a><a href="#footnote144b"
class="citation">[144b]</a> is admirable.&nbsp; You may see them
all three here every day, no more in the army than you.&nbsp;
Twelve shillings for mending the strong box; that is, for putting
a farthing&rsquo;s worth of iron on a hinge, and gilding it; give
him six shillings, and I&rsquo;ll pay it, and never employ him or
his again.&mdash;No indeed, I put off preaching as much as I
can.&nbsp; I am upon another foot: nobody doubts here whether I
can preach, and you are fools.&mdash;The account you give of that
weekly paper <a name="citation144c"></a><a href="#footnote144c"
class="citation">[144c]</a> agrees with us here.&nbsp; Mr. Prior
was like to be insulted in the street for being supposed the
author of it; but one of the last papers cleared him.&nbsp;
Nobody knows who it is, but those few in the secret, I suppose
the Ministry and the printer.&mdash;Poor Stella&rsquo;s
eyes!&nbsp; God bless them, and send them better.&nbsp; Pray
spare them, and write not above two lines a day in broad
daylight.&nbsp; How <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>does Stella look, Madam
Dingley?&nbsp; Pretty well, a handsome young woman still.&nbsp;
Will she pass in a crowd?&nbsp; Will she make a figure in a
country church?&mdash;Stay a little, fair ladies.&nbsp; I this
minute sent Patrick to Sterne: he brings back word that your box
is very safe with one Mr. Earl&rsquo;s sister in Chester, and
that Colonel Edgworth&rsquo;s widow <a name="citation145a"></a><a
href="#footnote145a" class="citation">[145a]</a> goes for Ireland
on Monday next, and will receive the box at Chester, and deliver
it you safe: so there are some hopes now.&mdash;Well, let us go
on to your letter.&mdash;The warrant is passed for the
First-Fruits.&nbsp; The Queen does not send a letter; but a
patent will be drawn here, and that will take up time.&nbsp; Mr.
Harley of late has said nothing of presenting me to the Queen: I
was overseen <a name="citation145b"></a><a href="#footnote145b"
class="citation">[145b]</a> when I mentioned it to you.&nbsp; He
has such a weight of affairs on him, that he cannot mind all; but
he talked of it three or four times to me, long before I dropped
it to you.&nbsp; What, is not Mrs. Walls&rsquo; business over
yet?&nbsp; I had hopes she was up and well, and the child dead
before this time.&mdash;You did right, at last, to send me your
accompts; but I did not stay for them, I thank you.&nbsp; I hope
you have your bill sent in my last, and there will be eight
pounds&rsquo; interest soon due from Hawkshaw: pray look at his
bond.&nbsp; I hope you are good managers; and that, when I say
so, Stella won&rsquo;t think I intend she should grudge herself
wine.&nbsp; But going to those expensive lodgings requires some
fund.&nbsp; I wish you had stayed till I came over, for some
reasons.&nbsp; That Frenchwoman <a name="citation145c"></a><a
href="#footnote145c" class="citation">[145c]</a> will be
grumbling again in a little time: and if you are invited anywhere
to the country, it will vex you to pay in absence; and the
country may be necessary for poor Stella&rsquo;s health: but do
as you like, and do not blame Presto.&mdash;Oh, but you are
telling your reasons.&mdash;Well, I have read them; do as you
please.&mdash;Yes, Raymond says he must stay longer than he
thought, because he cannot settle his affairs.&nbsp; M&mdash; is
in the country at some friend&rsquo;s, comes <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>to town in
spring, and then goes to settle in Herefordshire.&nbsp; Her
husband is a surly, ill-natured brute, and cares not she should
see anybody.&nbsp; O Lord, see how I blundered, and left two
lines short; it was that ugly score in the paper <a
name="citation146a"></a><a href="#footnote146a"
class="citation">[146a]</a> that made me mistake.&mdash;I believe
you lie about the story of the fire, only to make it more
odd.&nbsp; Bernage must go to Spain; and I will see to recommend
him to the Duke of Argyle, his General, when I see the Duke next:
but the officers tell me it would be dishonourable in the last
degree for him to sell now, and he would never be preferred in
the army; so that, unless he designs to leave it for good and
all, he must go.&nbsp; Tell him so, and that I would write if I
knew where to direct to him; which I have said fourscore times
already.&nbsp; I had rather anything almost than that you should
strain yourselves to send a letter when it is inconvenient; we
have settled that matter already.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll write when I
can, and so shall MD; and upon occasions extraordinary I will
write, though it be a line; and when we have not letters soon, we
agree that all things are well; and so that&rsquo;s settled for
ever, and so hold your tongue.&mdash;Well, you shall have your
pins; but for candles&rsquo; ends, I cannot promise, because I
burn them to the stumps; besides, I remember what Stella told
Dingley about them many years ago, and she may think the same
thing of me.&mdash;And Dingley shall have her hinged
spectacles.&mdash;Poor dear Stella, how durst you write those two
lines by candlelight? bang your bones!&nbsp; Faith, this letter
shall go to-morrow, I think, and that will be in ten days from
the last, young women; that&rsquo;s too soon of all conscience:
but answering yours has filled it up so quick, and I do not
design to use you to three pages in folio, no, nooooh.&nbsp; All
this is one morning&rsquo;s work in bed;&mdash;and so
good-morrow, little sirrahs; that&rsquo;s for the rhyme. <a
name="citation146b"></a><a href="#footnote146b"
class="citation">[146b]</a>&nbsp; You want politics: faith, I
can&rsquo;t think of any; but may be at night I may tell you a
passage.&nbsp; Come, sit off the bed, <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>and let me rise, will you?&mdash;At
night.&nbsp; I dined to-day with my neighbour Vanhomrigh; it was
such dismal weather I could not stir further.&nbsp; I have had
some threatenings with my head, but no fits.&nbsp; I still drink
Dr. Radcliffe&rsquo;s <a name="citation147a"></a><a
href="#footnote147a" class="citation">[147a]</a> bitter, and will
continue it.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; I was this morning to see the Secretary of State,
and have engaged him to give a memorial from me to the Duke of
Argyle in behalf of Bernage.&nbsp; The Duke is a man that
distinguishes people of merit, and I will speak to him myself;
but the Secretary backing it will be very effectual, and I will
take care to have it done to purpose.&nbsp; Pray tell Bernage so,
and that I think nothing can be luckier for him, and that I would
have him go by all means.&nbsp; I will order it that the Duke
shall send for him when they are in Spain; or, if he fails, that
he shall receive him kindly when he goes to wait on him.&nbsp;
Can I do more?&nbsp; Is not this a great deal?&mdash;I now send
away this letter, that you may not stay.&mdash;I dined with Ford
upon his Opera-day, and am now come home, and am going to study;
do not you presume to guess, sirrahs, impudent saucy dear
boxes.&nbsp; Towards the end of a letter I could not say saucy
boxes without putting dear between.&nbsp; An&rsquo;t that right
now?&nbsp; Farewell.&nbsp; <i>This</i> should <i>be</i> longer,
<i>but</i> that <i>I</i> send <i>it</i> to-<i>night</i>. <a
name="citation147b"></a><a href="#footnote147b"
class="citation">[147b]</a></p>
<p>O silly, silly loggerhead!</p>
<p>I send a letter this post to one Mr. Staunton, and I direct it
to Mr. Acton&rsquo;s in St. Michael&rsquo;s Lane.&nbsp; He
formerly lodged there, but he has not told me where to
direct.&nbsp; Pray send to that Acton, whether <a
name="citation147c"></a><a href="#footnote147c"
class="citation">[147c]</a> the letter is come there, and whether
he has sent it to Staunton.</p>
<p>If Bernage designs to sell his commission and stay at home,
pray let him tell me so, that my recommendation to the Duke of
Argyle may not be in vain.</p>

148</span>LETTER XVI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Feb.</i> 10, 1710&ndash;11.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> just despatched my fifteenth
to the post; I tell you how things will be, after I have got a
letter from MD.&nbsp; I am in furious haste to finish mine, for
fear of having two of MD&rsquo;s to answer in one of
Presto&rsquo;s, which would be such a disgrace, never saw the
like; but, before you write to me, I write at my leisure, like a
gentleman, a little every day, just to let you know how matters
go, and so and so; and I hope before this comes to you,
you&rsquo;ll have got your box and chocolate, and Presto will
take more care another time.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I must rise and go see my Lord
Keeper, <a name="citation148a"></a><a href="#footnote148a"
class="citation">[148a]</a> which will cost me two shillings in
coach-hire.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you call them two thirteens? <a
name="citation148b"></a><a href="#footnote148b"
class="citation">[148b]</a>&mdash;At night.&nbsp; It has rained
all day, and there was no walking.&nbsp; I read prayers to Sir
Andrew Fountaine in the forenoon, and I dined with three
Irishmen, at one Mr. Cope&rsquo;s <a name="citation148c"></a><a
href="#footnote148c" class="citation">[148c]</a> lodgings; the
other two were one Morris an archdeacon, <a
name="citation148d"></a><a href="#footnote148d"
class="citation">[148d]</a> and Mr. Ford.&nbsp; When I came home
this evening, I expected that little jackanapes Harrison would
have come to get help about his <i>Tatler</i> for Tuesday: I have
fixed two evenings in the week which I allow him to come.&nbsp;
The toad never came, and I expecting him fell a reading, and left
off other business.&mdash;Come, what are you doing?&nbsp; How do
you pass your time this ugly weather?&nbsp; Gaming and drinking,
I suppose: fine diversions for young ladies, truly!&nbsp; I wish
you had some of our Seville oranges, and we some of your
wine.&nbsp; We have the finest oranges for twopence apiece, and
the basest wine for six shillings a bottle.&nbsp; They tell me
wine grows cheap with you.&nbsp; I am resolved to have half a
hogshead when I get to Ireland, if it be good and <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>cheap, as
it used to be; and I will treat MD at my table in an evening, oh
hoa, and laugh at great Ministers of State.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; The days are grown fine and long, &mdash; be
thanked.&nbsp; O, faith, you forget all our little sayings, and I
am angry.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Mr. Secretary St. John: I
went to the Court of Requests at noon, and sent Mr. Harley into
the House to call the Secretary, to let him know I would not dine
with him if he dined late.&nbsp; By good luck the Duke of Argyle
was at the lobby of the House too, and I kept him in talk till
the Secretary came out; then told them I was glad to meet them
together, and that I had a request to the Duke, which the
Secretary must second, and his Grace must grant.&nbsp; The Duke
said he was sure it was something insignificant, and wished it
was ten times greater.&nbsp; At the Secretary&rsquo;s house I
writ a memorial, and gave it to the Secretary to give the Duke,
and shall see that he does it.&nbsp; It is, that his Grace will
please to take Mr. Bernage into his protection; and if he finds
Bernage answers my character, to give him all
encouragement.&nbsp; Colonel Masham <a name="citation149a"></a><a
href="#footnote149a" class="citation">[149a]</a> and Colonel Hill
<a name="citation149b"></a><a href="#footnote149b"
class="citation">[149b]</a> (Mrs. Masham&rsquo;s <a
name="citation149c"></a><a href="#footnote149c"
class="citation">[149c]</a>) brother tell me my request is
reasonable, and they will second it heartily to the Duke too: so
I reckon Bernage is on a very good foot when he goes to
Spain.&nbsp; Pray tell him this, though perhaps I will write to
him before he goes; yet where shall I direct? for I suppose he
has left Connolly&rsquo;s. <a name="citation149d"></a><a
href="#footnote149d" class="citation">[149d]</a></p>
<p>13.&nbsp; I have left off Lady Kerry&rsquo;s bitter, and got
another box of pills.&nbsp; I have no fits of giddiness, but only
some little disorders towards it; and I walk as much as I
can.&nbsp; Lady Kerry is just as I am, only a great deal worse: I
dined <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>to-day at Lord Shelburne&rsquo;s, where she is, and we
con ailments, which makes us very fond of each other.&nbsp; I
have taken Mr. Harley into favour again, and called to see him,
but he was not within; I will use to visit him after dinner, for
he dines too late for my head: then I went to visit poor
Congreve, who is just getting out of a severe fit of the gout;
and I sat with him till near nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He gave me
a <i>Tatler</i> <a name="citation150a"></a><a
href="#footnote150a" class="citation">[150a]</a> he had written
out, as blind as he is, for little Harrison.&nbsp; It is about a
scoundrel that was grown rich, and went and bought a coat of arms
at the Herald&rsquo;s, and a set of ancestors at Fleet Ditch;
&rsquo;tis well enough, and shall be printed in two or three
days, and if you read those kind of things, this will divert
you.&nbsp; It is now between ten and eleven, and I am going to
bed.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; This was Mrs. Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s <a
name="citation150b"></a><a href="#footnote150b"
class="citation">[150b]</a> birthday, and Mr. Ford and I were
invited to dinner to keep it, and we spent the evening there,
drinking punch.&nbsp; That was our way of beginning Lent; and in
the morning Lord Shelburne, Lady Kerry, Mrs. Pratt, and I, went
to Hyde Park, instead of going to church; for, till my head is a
little settled, I think it better not to go; it would be so silly
and troublesome to go out sick.&nbsp; Dr. Duke <a
name="citation150c"></a><a href="#footnote150c"
class="citation">[150c]</a> died suddenly two or three nights
ago; he was one of the wits when we were children, but turned
parson, and left it, and never writ farther than a prologue or
recommendatory copy of verses.&nbsp; He had a fine living given
him by the Bishop of Winchester <a name="citation150d"></a><a
href="#footnote150d" class="citation">[150d]</a> about three
months ago; he got his living suddenly, and he got his dying so
too.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; I walked purely to-day about the Park, the rain
being just over, of which we have had a great deal, mixed with
little short frosts.&nbsp; I went to the Court of Requests,
thinking, if Mr. Harley dined early, to go with him.&nbsp; But
meeting Leigh <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>and Sterne, they invited me to dine with them, and away
we went.&nbsp; When we got into his room, one H&mdash;, a
worthless Irish fellow, was there, ready to dine with us; so I
stepped out, and whispered them, that I would not dine with that
fellow: they made excuses, and begged me to stay; but away I went
to Mr. Harley&rsquo;s, and he did not dine at home; and at last I
dined at Sir John Germaine&rsquo;s, <a name="citation151a"></a><a
href="#footnote151a" class="citation">[151a]</a> and found Lady
Betty but just recovered of a miscarriage.&nbsp; I am writing an
inscription for Lord Berkeley&rsquo;s <a
name="citation151b"></a><a href="#footnote151b"
class="citation">[151b]</a> tomb; you know the young rake his
son, the new Earl, is married to the Duke of Richmond&rsquo;s
daughter, <a name="citation151c"></a><a href="#footnote151c"
class="citation">[151c]</a> at the Duke&rsquo;s country house,
and are now coming to town.&nbsp; She will be fluxed in two
months, and they&rsquo;ll be parted in a year.&nbsp; You ladies
are brave, bold, venturesome folks; and the chit is but
seventeen, and is ill-natured, covetous, vicious, and proud in
extremes.&nbsp; And so get you gone to Stoyte to-morrow.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; Faith, this letter goes on but slow; &rsquo;tis a
week old, and the first side not written.&nbsp; I went to-day
into the City for a walk, but the person I designed to dine with
was not at home; so I came back, and called at Congreve&rsquo;s,
and dined with him and Estcourt, <a name="citation151d"></a><a
href="#footnote151d" class="citation">[151d]</a> and laughed till
six; then went to Mr. Harley&rsquo;s, who was not gone to dinner;
there I stayed till nine, and we made up our quarrel, and he has
invited me to dinner to-morrow, which is the day of the week
(Saturday) that Lord Keeper and Secretary St. John dine with him
privately, and at last they have consented to let me among them
on that day.&nbsp; Atterbury and Prior went to bury poor Dr.
Duke.&nbsp; Congreve&rsquo;s nasty white wine has given me the
heart-burn.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; I took some good walks in the Park to-day, and then
went to Mr. Harley.&nbsp; Lord Rivers was got there before me,
and I chid him for presuming to come on a day when only Lord
Keeper and the Secretary and I were to be there; but he regarded
me not; so we all dined together, and sat down at four; and the
Secretary has invited me to dine with him to-morrow.&nbsp; I told
them I had no hopes they could ever <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>keep in, but that I saw they loved
one another so well, as indeed they seem to do.&nbsp; They call
me nothing but Jonathan; and I said I believed they would leave
me Jonathan as they found me; and that I never knew a Ministry do
anything for those whom they make companions of their pleasures;
and I believe you will find it so; but I care not.&nbsp; I am
upon a project of getting five hundred pounds, <a
name="citation152a"></a><a href="#footnote152a"
class="citation">[152a]</a> without being obliged to anybody; but
that is a secret, till I see my dearest MD; and so hold your
tongue, and do not talk, sirrahs, for I am now about it.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; My head has no fits, but a little disordered before
dinner; yet I walk stoutly, and take pills, and hope to
mend.&nbsp; Secretary St. John would needs have me dine with him
to-day; and there I found three persons I never saw, two I had no
acquaintance with, and one I did not care for: so I left them
early and came home, it being no day to walk, but scurvy rain and
wind.&nbsp; The Secretary tells me he has put a cheat on me; for
Lord Peterborow sent him twelve dozen flasks of burgundy, on
condition that I should have my share; but he never was quiet
till they were all gone, so I reckon he owes me thirty-six
pounds.&nbsp; Lord Peterborow is now got to Vienna, and I must
write to him to-morrow.&nbsp; I begin now to be towards looking
for a letter from some certain ladies of Presto&rsquo;s
acquaintance, that live at St. Mary&rsquo;s, <a
name="citation152b"></a><a href="#footnote152b"
class="citation">[152b]</a> and are called in a certain language,
our little MD.&nbsp; No, stay, I don&rsquo;t expect one these six
days, that will be just three weeks; an&rsquo;t I a reasonable
creature?&nbsp; We are plagued here with an October Club, that
is, a set of above a hundred Parliament men of the country, who
drink October beer at home, and meet every evening at a tavern
near the Parliament to consult affairs, and drive things on to
extremes against the Whigs, to call the old Ministry to account,
and get off five or six heads. <a name="citation152c"></a><a
href="#footnote152c" class="citation">[152c]</a>&nbsp; The
Ministry seem not to regard them; yet one of them in confidence
told me that there <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>must be something thought on, to settle things
better.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you one great State secret: the
Queen, sensible how much she was governed by the late Ministry,
runs a little into t&rsquo;other extreme, and is jealous in that
point, even of those who got her out of the others&rsquo;
hands.&nbsp; The Ministry is for gentler measures, and the other
Tories for more violent.&nbsp; Lord Rivers, talking to me the
other day, cursed the paper called the <i>Examiner</i>, for
speaking civilly of the Duke of Marlborough; this I happened to
talk of to the Secretary, who blamed the warmth of that lord and
some others, and swore that if their advice were followed they
would be blown up in twenty-four hours.&nbsp; And I have reason
to think that they will endeavour to prevail on the Queen to put
her affairs more in the hands of a Ministry than she does at
present; and there are, I believe, two men thought on, one of
them you have often met the name of in my letters.&nbsp; But so
much for politics.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; This proved a terrible rainy day, which prevented my
walk into the City, and I was only able to run and dine with my
neighbour Vanhomrigh, where Sir Andrew Fountaine dined too, who
has just began to sally out, and has shipped his mother and
sister, who were his nurses, back to the country.&nbsp; This
evening was fair, and I walked a little in the Park, till Prior
made me go with him to the Smyrna Coffee-house, where I sat a
while, and saw four or five Irish persons, who are very handsome,
genteel fellows; but I know not their names.&nbsp; I came away at
seven, and got home.&nbsp; Two days ago I writ to Bernage, and
told him what I had done, and directed the letter to Mr.
Curry&rsquo;s, to be left with Dingley.&nbsp; Brigadiers Hill and
Masham, brother and husband to Mrs. Masham, the Queen&rsquo;s
favourite, Colonel Disney, <a name="citation153"></a><a
href="#footnote153" class="citation">[153]</a> and <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>I, have
recommended Bernage to the Duke of Argyle; and Secretary St. John
has given the Duke my memorial; and, besides, Hill tells me, that
Bernage&rsquo;s colonel, Fielding, <a name="citation154"></a><a
href="#footnote154" class="citation">[154]</a> designs to make
him his captain-lieutenant: but I believe I said this to you
before, and in this letter; but I will not look.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; It snows terribly again; and
&rsquo;tis mistaken, for I now want a little good weather.&nbsp;
I bid you good-morrow; and, if it clear up, get you gone to poor
Mrs. Walls, who has had a hard time of it, but is now pretty well
again.&nbsp; I am sorry it is a girl: the poor Archdeacon too,
see how simply he looked when they told him: what did it cost
Stella to be gossip?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll rise; so, d&rsquo;ye hear,
let me see you at night; and do not stay late out, and catch
cold, sirrahs.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; It grew good weather, and I
got a good walk, and dined with Ford upon his Opera-day; but, now
all his wine is gone, I shall dine with him no more.&nbsp; I hope
to send this letter before I hear from MD, methinks there
is&mdash;something great in doing so, only I can&rsquo;t express
where it lies; and, faith, this shall go by Saturday, as sure as
you&rsquo;re a rogue.&nbsp; Mrs. Edgworth was to set out but last
Monday; so you won&rsquo;t have your box so soon perhaps as this
letter; but Sterne told me since that it is safe at Chester, and
that she will take care of it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d give a guinea you
had it.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Faith, I hope it will be fair for me
to walk into the City; for I take all occasions of
walking.&mdash;I should be plaguy busy at Laracor if I were there
now, cutting down willows, planting others, scouring my canal,
and every kind of thing.&nbsp; If Raymond goes over this summer,
you must submit, and make them a visit, that we may have another
eel and trout fishing; and that Stella may ride by, and see <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>Presto in
his morning-gown in the garden, and so go up with Joe to the Hill
of Bree, and round by Scurlock&rsquo;s Town.&nbsp; O Lord, how I
remember names! faith, it gives me short sighs; therefore no more
of that, if you love me.&nbsp; Good-morrow, I will go rise like a
gentleman; my pills say I must.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; Lady Kerry
sent to desire me to engage some lords about an affair she has in
their house here: I called to see her, but found she had already
engaged every lord I knew, and that there was no great difficulty
in the matter; and it rained like a dog; so I took coach, for
want of better exercise, and dined privately with a hang-dog in
the City, and walked back in the evening.&nbsp; The days are now
long enough to walk in the Park after dinner; and so I do
whenever it is fair.&nbsp; This walking is a strange remedy: Mr.
Prior walks, to make himself fat, and I to bring myself down; he
has generally a cough, which he only calls a cold; we often walk
round the Park together.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;ll go sleep.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; It snowed all this morning prodigiously, and was
some inches thick in three or four hours.&nbsp; I dined with Mr.
Lewis of the Secretary&rsquo;s office at his lodgings: the
chairmen that carried me squeezed a great fellow against a wall,
who wisely turned his back, and broke one of the side-glasses in
a thousand pieces.&nbsp; I fell a scolding, pretended I was like
to be cut to pieces, and made them set down the chair in the
Park, while they picked out the bits of glasses; and, when I paid
them, I quarrelled still; so they dared not grumble, and I came
off for my fare; but I was plaguily afraid they would have said,
&ldquo;God bless your honour, won&rsquo;t you give us something
for our glass?&rdquo;&nbsp; Lewis and I were forming a project
how I might get three or four hundred pounds, <a
name="citation155"></a><a href="#footnote155"
class="citation">[155]</a> which I suppose may come to
nothing.&nbsp; I hope Smyth has brought you your
palsy-drops.&nbsp; How does Stella do?&nbsp; I begin more and
more to desire to know.&nbsp; The three weeks since I had your
last is over within two days, and I will allow three for
accidents.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; The snow is gone every bit, except the remainder of
<a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>some
great balls made by the boys.&nbsp; Mr. Sterne was with me this
morning about an affair he has before the Treasury.&nbsp; That
drab Mrs. Edgworth is not yet set out, but will infallibly next
Monday: and this is the third infallible Monday, and pox take
her!&nbsp; So you will have this letter first; and this shall go
to-morrow; and, if I have one from MD in that time, I will not
answer it till my next; only I will say, &ldquo;Madam, I received
your letter, and so, and so.&rdquo;&nbsp; I dined to-day with my
Mistress Butler, <a name="citation156a"></a><a
href="#footnote156a" class="citation">[156a]</a> who grows very
disagreeable.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; This letter certainly goes this
evening, sure as you&rsquo;re alive, young women, and then you
will be so shamed that I have had none from you; and, if I was to
reckon like you, I would say, I were six letters before you, for
this is N. 16, and I have had your N. 10.&nbsp; But I reckon you
have received but fourteen, and have sent eleven.&nbsp; I think
to go to-day a Minister-of-State-hunting in the Court of
Requests; for I have something to say to Mr. Harley.&nbsp; And it
is fine, cold, sunshiny weather; I wish dear MD would walk this
morning in your Stephen&rsquo;s Green; &rsquo;tis as good as our
Park, but not so large. <a name="citation156b"></a><a
href="#footnote156b" class="citation">[156b]</a>&nbsp; Faith,
this summer we&rsquo;ll take a coach for sixpence <a
name="citation156c"></a><a href="#footnote156c"
class="citation">[156c]</a> to the Green Well, the two walks, and
thence all the way to Stoyte&rsquo;s. <a
name="citation156d"></a><a href="#footnote156d"
class="citation">[156d]</a>&nbsp; My hearty service to Goody
Stoyte and Catherine; and I hope Mrs. Walls had a good
time.&nbsp; How inconstant I am! I can&rsquo;t imagine I was ever
in love with her.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m going; what have you to
say?&nbsp; <i>I do not care how I write now</i>. <a
name="citation156e"></a><a href="#footnote156e"
class="citation">[156e]</a>&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t design to write
on this side; these few lines are but so much more than your due;
so I will write <i>large</i> or small as I please.&nbsp; O,
faith, my hands are starving in bed; I believe it is a hard
frost.&nbsp; I must rise, and bid you good-bye, for I&rsquo;ll
seal this letter <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>immediately, and carry it in my pocket, and put it into
the post-office with my own fair hands.&nbsp; Farewell.</p>
<p>This letter is just a fortnight&rsquo;s journal to-day.&nbsp;
Yes, and so it is, I&rsquo;m sure, says you, with your two eggs a
penny.</p>
<p>Lele, lele, lele. <a name="citation157"></a><a
href="#footnote157" class="citation">[157]</a></p>
<p>O Lord, I am saying lele, lele, to myself, in all our little
keys: and, now you talk of keys, that dog Patrick broke the
key-general of the chest of drawers with six locks, and I have
been so plagued to get a new one, besides my good two
shillings!</p>
<h3>LETTER XVII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Feb.</i> 24, 1710&ndash;11.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Now</span>, young women, I gave in my
sixteenth this evening.&nbsp; I dined with Ford (it was his
Opera-day) as usual; it is very convenient to me to do so, for
coming home early after a walk in the Park, which now the days
will allow.&nbsp; I called on the Secretary at his office, and he
had forgot to give the memorial about Bernage to the Duke of
Argyle; but, two days ago, I met the Duke, who desired I would
give it him myself, which should have more power with him than
all the Ministry together, as he protested solemnly, repeated it
two or three times, and bid me count upon it.&nbsp; So that I
verily believe Bernage will be in a very good way to establish
himself.&nbsp; I think I can do no more for him at present, and
there&rsquo;s an end of that; and so get you gone to bed, for it
is late.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; The three weeks are out yesterday since I had your
last, and so now I will be expecting every day a pretty dear
letter from my own MD, and hope to hear that Stella has been much
better in her head and eyes: my head continues as it was, no
fits, but a little disorder every day, which I can easily bear,
if it will not grow worse.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Mr. <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>Secretary
St. John, on condition I might choose my company, which were Lord
Rivers, Lord Carteret, Sir Thomas Mansel, <a
name="citation158a"></a><a href="#footnote158a"
class="citation">[158a]</a> and Mr. Lewis; I invited Masham,
Hill, Sir John Stanley, and George Granville, but they were
engaged; and I did it in revenge of his having such bad company
when I dined with him before; so we laughed, etc.&nbsp; And I
ventured to go to church to-day, which I have not done this month
before.&nbsp; Can you send me such a good account of
Stella&rsquo;s health, pray now?&nbsp; Yes, I hope, and better
too.&nbsp; We dined (says you) at the Dean&rsquo;s, and played at
cards till twelve, and there came in Mr. French, and Dr. Travors,
and Dr. Whittingham, and Mr. (I forget his name, that I always
tell Mrs. Walls of) the banker&rsquo;s son, a pox on him.&nbsp;
And we were so merry; I vow they are pure good company.&nbsp; But
I lost a crown; for you must know I had always hands tempting me
to go out, but never took in anything, and often two black aces
without a manilio; was not that hard, Presto?&nbsp; Hold your
tongue, etc.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; I was this morning with Mr. Secretary about some
business, and he tells me that Colonel Fielding is now going to
make Bernage his captain-lieutenant, that is, a captain by
commission, and the perquisites of the company; but not
captain&rsquo;s pay, only the first step to it.&nbsp; I suppose
he will like it; and the recommendation to the Duke of Argyle
goes on.&nbsp; And so trouble me no more about your Bernage; the
jackanapes understands what fair solicitors he has got, I warrant
you.&nbsp; Sir Andrew Fountaine and I dined, by invitation, with
Mrs. Vanhomrigh.&nbsp; You say they are of no consequence: why,
they keep as good female company as I do male; I see all the
drabs of quality at this end of the town with them: I saw two
Lady Bettys <a name="citation158b"></a><a href="#footnote158b"
class="citation">[158b]</a> there this afternoon; the beauty of
one, the good-breeding and nature of t&rsquo;other, and the wit
of neither, would have made a fine woman.&nbsp; Rare walking in
<a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>the Park
now: why don&rsquo;t you walk in the Green of St. Stephen?&nbsp;
The walks there are finer gravelled than the Mall.&nbsp; What
beasts the Irish women are, never to walk!</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; Darteneuf and I, and little Harrison the new Tatler,
and Jervas the painter, dined to-day with James, <a
name="citation159"></a><a href="#footnote159"
class="citation">[159]</a> I know not his other name, but it is
one of Darteneuf&rsquo;s dining-places, who is a true
epicure.&nbsp; James is clerk of the kitchen to the Queen, and
has a little snug house at St. James&rsquo;s; and we had the
Queen&rsquo;s wine, and such very fine victuals that I could not
eat it.&nbsp; Three weeks and three days since my last letter
from MD; rare doings! why, truly we were so busy with poor Mrs.
Walls, that indeed, Presto, we could not write, we were afraid
the poor woman would have died; and it pitied us to see the
Archdeacon, how concerned he was.&nbsp; The Dean never came to
see her but once; but now she is up again, and we go and sit with
her in the evenings.&nbsp; The child died the next day after it
was born; and I believe, between friends, she is not very sorry
for it.&mdash;Indeed, Presto, you are plaguy silly to-night, and
han&rsquo;t guessed one word right; for she and the child are
both well, and it is a fine girl, likely to live; and the Dean
was godfather, and Mrs. Catherine and I were godmothers; I was
going to say Stoyte, but I think I have heard they don&rsquo;t
put maids and married women together; though I know not why I
think so, nor I don&rsquo;t care; what care I? but I must prate,
etc.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; I walked to-day into the City for my health, and
there dined; which I always do when the weather is fair, and
business permits, that I may be under a necessity of taking a
good walk, which is the best thing I can do at present for my
health.&nbsp; Some bookseller has raked up everything I writ, and
published it t&rsquo;other day in one volume; but I know nothing
of it, &rsquo;twas without my knowledge or consent: it makes a <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>four-shilling book, and is called <i>Miscellanies in
Prose and Verse</i>. <a name="citation160a"></a><a
href="#footnote160a" class="citation">[160a]</a>&nbsp; Tooke
pretends he knows nothing of it; but I doubt he is at the
bottom.&nbsp; One must have patience with these things; the best
of it is, I shall be plagued no more.&nbsp; However, I will bring
a couple of them over with me for MD; perhaps you may desire to
see them.&nbsp; I hear they sell mightily.</p>
<p>March 1.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I have been calling to Patrick
to look in his almanac for the day of the month; I did not know
but it might be leap-year.&nbsp; The almanac says &rsquo;tis the
third after leap-year; and I always thought till now, that every
third year was leap-year.&nbsp; I am glad they come so seldom;
but I&rsquo;m sure &rsquo;twas otherwise when I was a young man;
I see times are mightily changed since then.&mdash;Write to me,
sirrahs; be sure do by the time this side is done, and I&rsquo;ll
keep t&rsquo;other side for the answer: so I&rsquo;ll go write to
the Bishop of Clogher; good-morrow, sirrahs.&mdash;Night.&nbsp; I
dined to-day at Mrs. Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s, being a rainy day; and
Lady Betty Butler, knowing it, sent to let me know she expected
my company in the evening, where the Vans (so we call them) were
to be.&nbsp; The Duchess <a name="citation160b"></a><a
href="#footnote160b" class="citation">[160b]</a> and they do not
go over this summer with the Duke; so I go to bed.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; This rainy weather undoes me in coaches and
chairs.&nbsp; I was traipsing to-day with your Mr. Sterne, to go
along with them to Moore, <a name="citation160c"></a><a
href="#footnote160c" class="citation">[160c]</a> and recommend
his business to the Treasury.&nbsp; Sterne tells me <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>his
dependence is wholly on me; but I have absolutely refused to
recommend it to Mr. Harley, because I have troubled him lately so
much with other folks&rsquo; affairs; and besides, to tell the
truth, Mr. Harley told me he did not like Sterne&rsquo;s
business: however, I will serve him, because I suppose MD would
have me.&nbsp; But, in saying his dependence lies wholly on me,
he lies, and is a fool.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Abercorn, whose
son Peasley <a name="citation161a"></a><a href="#footnote161a"
class="citation">[161a]</a> will be married at Easter to ten
thousand pounds.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I forgot to tell you that yesterday morning I was at
Mr. Harley&rsquo;s levee: he swore I came in spite, to see him
among a parcel of fools.&nbsp; My business was to desire I might
let the Duke of Ormond know how the affair stood of the
First-Fruits.&nbsp; He promised to let him know it, and engaged
me to dine with him to-day.&nbsp; Every Saturday, Lord Keeper,
Secretary St. John, and I dine with him, and sometimes Lord
Rivers; and they let in none else.&nbsp; Patrick brought me some
letters into the Park; among which one was from Walls; and
t&rsquo;other, yes, faith, t&rsquo;other was from our little MD,
N. 11.&nbsp; I read the rest in the Park, and MD&rsquo;s in a
chair as I went from St. James&rsquo;s to Mr. Harley; and glad
enough I was, faith, to read it, and see all right.&nbsp; Oh, but
I won&rsquo;t answer it these three or four days at least, or may
be sooner.&nbsp; An&rsquo;t I silly? faith, your letters would
make a dog silly, if I had a dog to be silly, but it must be a
little dog.&mdash;I stayed with Mr. Harley till past nine, where
we had much discourse together after the rest were gone; and I
gave him very truly my opinion where he desired it.&nbsp; He
complained he was not very well, and has engaged me to dine with
him again on Monday.&nbsp; So I came home afoot, like a fine
gentleman, to tell you all this.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Mr. Secretary St. John; and after
dinner he had a note from Mr. Harley, that he was much out of
order. <a name="citation161b"></a><a href="#footnote161b"
class="citation">[161b]</a>&nbsp; Pray God preserve his health!
everything depends upon it.&nbsp; The Parliament at present
cannot go a step without him, nor the Queen neither.&nbsp; I long
to be in Ireland; but the Ministry beg me to stay: however, when
this Parliament lurry <a name="citation161c"></a><a
href="#footnote161c" class="citation">[161c]</a> is over, I will
endeavour to steal away; by which time I hope the First-Fruit
business will be done.&nbsp; This kingdom is certainly ruined as
much as was ever any bankrupt <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>merchant.&nbsp; We must have peace,
let it be a bad or a good one, though nobody dares talk of
it.&nbsp; The nearer I look upon things, the worse I like
them.&nbsp; I believe the confederacy will soon break to pieces,
and our factions at home increase.&nbsp; The Ministry is upon a
very narrow bottom, and stand like an isthmus, between the Whigs
on one side, and violent Tories on the other.&nbsp; They are able
seamen; but the tempest is too great, the ship too rotten, and
the crew all against them.&nbsp; Lord Somers has been twice in
the Queen&rsquo;s closet, once very lately; and your Duchess of
Somerset, <a name="citation162"></a><a href="#footnote162"
class="citation">[162]</a> who now has the key, is a most
insinuating woman; and I believe they will endeavour to play the
same game that has been played against them.&mdash;I have told
them of all this, which they know already, but they cannot help
it.&nbsp; They have cautioned the Queen so much against being
governed, that she observes it too much.&nbsp; I could talk till
to-morrow upon these things, but they make me melancholy.&nbsp; I
could not but observe that lately, after much conversation with
Mr. Harley, though he is the most fearless man alive, and the
least apt to despond, he confessed to me that uttering his mind
to me gave him ease.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Mr. Harley continues out of order, yet his affairs
force him abroad: he is subject to a sore throat, and was cupped
last night: I sent and called two or three times.&nbsp; I hear he
is better this evening.&nbsp; I dined to-day in the City with Dr.
Freind at a third body&rsquo;s house, where I was to pass for
somebody else; and there was a plaguy silly jest carried on, that
made me sick of it.&nbsp; Our weather grows fine, and I will walk
like camomile.&nbsp; And pray walk you to your Dean&rsquo;s, or
your Stoyte&rsquo;s, or your Manley&rsquo;s, or your
Walls&rsquo;.&nbsp; But your new lodgings make you so proud, you
will walk less than ever.&nbsp; Come, let me go to bed,
sirrahs.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Mr. Harley&rsquo;s going out yesterday has put him a
little backwards.&nbsp; I called twice, and sent, for I am in
pain for <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>him.&nbsp; Ford caught me, and made me dine with him on
his Opera-day; so I brought Mr. Lewis with me, and sat with him
till six.&nbsp; I have not seen Mr. Addison these three weeks;
all our friendship is over.&nbsp; I go to no Coffee-house.&nbsp;
I presented a parson of the Bishop of Clogher&rsquo;s, one
Richardson, <a name="citation163a"></a><a href="#footnote163a"
class="citation">[163a]</a> to the Duke of Ormond to-day: he is
translating prayers and sermons into Irish, and has a project
about instructing the Irish in the Protestant religion.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Faith, a little would make me, I could
find in my heart, if it were not for one thing, I have a good
mind, if I had not something else to do, I would answer your dear
saucy letter.&nbsp; O, Lord, I am going awry with writing in
bed.&nbsp; O, faith, but I must answer it, or I shan&rsquo;t have
room, for it must go on Saturday; and don&rsquo;t think I will
fill the third side, I an&rsquo;t come to that yet, young
women.&nbsp; Well then, as for your Bernage, I have said enough:
I writ to him last week.&mdash;Turn over that leaf.&nbsp; Now,
what says MD to the world to come?&nbsp; I tell you, Madam
Stella, my head is a great deal better, and I hope will keep
so.&nbsp; How came yours to be fifteen days coming, and you had
my fifteenth in seven?&nbsp; Answer me that, rogues.&nbsp; Your
being with Goody Walls is excuse enough: I find I was mistaken in
the sex, &rsquo;tis a boy. <a name="citation163b"></a><a
href="#footnote163b" class="citation">[163b]</a>&nbsp; Yes, I
understand your cypher, and Stella guesses right, as she always
does.&nbsp; He <a name="citation163c"></a><a href="#footnote163c"
class="citation">[163c]</a> gave me al bsadnuk lboinlpl dfaonr
ufainf btoy dpionufnad, <a name="citation163d"></a><a
href="#footnote163d" class="citation">[163d]</a> which I sent him
again by Mr. Lewis, to whom I writ a very complaining letter that
was showed him; and so the matter ended.&nbsp; He told me he had
a quarrel with me; I said I had another with him, and we returned
to our friendship, and I should think he <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>loves me as
well as a great Minister can love a man in so short a time.&nbsp;
Did not I do right?&nbsp; I am glad at heart you have got your
palsy-water; <a name="citation164a"></a><a href="#footnote164a"
class="citation">[164a]</a> pray God Almighty it may do my
dearest little Stella good!&nbsp; I suppose Mrs. Edgworth set out
last Monday se&rsquo;ennight.&nbsp; Yes, I do read the
<i>Examiners</i>, and they are written very finely, as you
judge.&nbsp; I do not think they are too severe on the Duke; <a
name="citation164b"></a><a href="#footnote164b"
class="citation">[164b]</a> they only tax him of avarice, and his
avarice has ruined us.&nbsp; You may count upon all things in
them to be true.&nbsp; The author has said it is not Prior, but
perhaps it may be Atterbury.&mdash;Now, Madam Dingley, says she,
&rsquo;tis fine weather, says she; yes, says she, and we have got
to our new lodgings.&nbsp; I compute you ought to save eight
pounds by being in the others five months; and you have no more
done it than eight thousand.&nbsp; I am glad you are rid of that
squinting, blinking Frenchman.&nbsp; I will give you a bill on
Parvisol for five pounds for the half-year.&nbsp; And must I go
on at four shillings a week, and neither eat nor drink for
it?&nbsp; Who the Devil said Atterbury and your Dean were
alike?&nbsp; I never saw your Chancellor, nor his chaplain.&nbsp;
The latter has a good deal of learning, and is a well-wisher to
be an author: your Chancellor is an excellent man.&nbsp; As for
Patrick&rsquo;s bird, he bought him for his tameness, and is
grown the wildest I ever saw.&nbsp; His wings have been quilled
thrice, and are now up again: he will be able to fly after us to
Ireland, if he be willing.&mdash;Yes, Mrs. Stella, Dingley writes
more like Presto than you; for all you superscribed the letter,
as who should say, Why should not I write like our Presto as well
as Dingley?&nbsp; You with your awkward SS; <a
name="citation164c"></a><a href="#footnote164c"
class="citation">[164c]</a> cannot you write them thus, SS?&nbsp;
No, but always SSS.&nbsp; Spiteful sluts, to affront
Presto&rsquo;s writing; as that when you shut your eyes you write
most like Presto.&nbsp; I know the time when I did not write to
you half so plain as I do now; but I take pity on you both.&nbsp;
I am very much concerned for Mrs. Walls&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Walls
says nothing of it to me in his letter <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>dated after
yours.&nbsp; You say, &ldquo;If she recovers, she may lose her
sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; I hope she is in no danger of her life.&nbsp;
Yes, Ford is as sober as I please: I use him to walk with me as
an easy companion, always ready for what I please, when I am
weary of business and Ministers.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t go to a
Coffee-house twice a month.&nbsp; I am very regular in going to
sleep before eleven.&mdash;And so you say that Stella is a pretty
girl; and so she be, and methinks I see her just now as handsome
as the day is long.&nbsp; Do you know what? when I am writing in
our language, I make up my mouth just as if I was speaking
it.&nbsp; I caught myself at it just now.&nbsp; And I suppose
Dingley is so fair and so fresh as a lass in May, and has her
health, and no spleen.&mdash;In your account you sent do you
reckon as usual from the 1st of November <a
name="citation165a"></a><a href="#footnote165a"
class="citation">[165a]</a> was twelvemonth?&nbsp; Poor Stella,
will not Dingley leave her a little daylight to write to
Presto?&nbsp; Well, well, we&rsquo;ll have daylight shortly,
spite of her teeth; and zoo <a name="citation165b"></a><a
href="#footnote165b" class="citation">[165b]</a> must cly Lele
and Hele, and Hele aden.&nbsp; Must loo mimitate Pdfr, pay?&nbsp;
Iss, and so la shall.&nbsp; And so lele&rsquo;s fol ee
rettle.&nbsp; Dood-mollow.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; Mrs. Barton sent
this morning to invite me to dinner; and there I dined, just in
that genteel manner that MD used when they would treat some
better sort of body than usual.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; O dear MD, my heart is almost broken.&nbsp; You will
hear the thing before this comes to you.&nbsp; I writ a full
account of it this night to the Archbishop of Dublin; and the
Dean may tell you the particulars from the Archbishop.&nbsp; I
was in a sorry way to write, but thought it might be proper to
send a true account of the fact; for you will hear a thousand
lying circumstances.&nbsp; It is of Mr. Harley&rsquo;s being
stabbed this afternoon, at three o&rsquo;clock, at a Committee of
the Council.&nbsp; <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>I was playing Lady Catharine Morris&rsquo;s <a
name="citation166a"></a><a href="#footnote166a"
class="citation">[166a]</a> cards, where I dined, when young
Arundel <a name="citation166b"></a><a href="#footnote166b"
class="citation">[166b]</a> came in with the story.&nbsp; I ran
away immediately to the Secretary, which was in my way: no one
was at home.&nbsp; I met Mrs. St. John in her chair; she had
heard it imperfectly.&nbsp; I took a chair to Mr. Harley, who was
asleep, and they hope in no danger; but he has been out of order,
and was so when he came abroad to-day, and it may put him in a
fever: I am in mortal pain for him.&nbsp; That desperate French
villain, Marquis de Guiscard, <a name="citation166c"></a><a
href="#footnote166c" class="citation">[166c]</a> stabbed Mr.
Harley.&nbsp; Guiscard was taken up by Mr. Secretary St.
John&rsquo;s warrant for high treason, and brought before the
Lords to be examined; there he stabbed Mr. Harley.&nbsp; I have
told all the particulars already to the Archbishop.&nbsp; I have
now, at nine, sent again, and they tell me he is in a fair
way.&nbsp; Pray pardon my distraction; I now think of all his
kindness to me.&mdash;The poor creature now lies stabbed in his
bed by a desperate French Popish villain.&nbsp; Good-night, and
God preserve you both, and pity me; I want it.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Morning; seven, in bed.&nbsp; Patrick is just come
from Mr. Harley&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He slept well till four; the
surgeon sat <a name="citation166d"></a><a href="#footnote166d"
class="citation">[166d]</a> up with him: he is asleep again: he
felt a pain in his wound when he waked: they apprehend him in no
danger.&nbsp; This account <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>the surgeon left with the porter, to
tell people that send.&nbsp; Pray God preserve him.&nbsp; I am
rising, and going to Mr. Secretary St. John.&nbsp; They say
Guiscard will die with the wounds Mr. St. John and the rest gave
him.&nbsp; I shall tell you more at night.&mdash;Night.&nbsp; Mr.
Harley still continues on the mending hand; but he rested ill
last night, and felt pain.&nbsp; I was early with the Secretary
this morning, and I dined with him, and he told me several
particularities of this accident, too long to relate now.&nbsp;
Mr. Harley is still mending this evening, but not at all out of
danger; and till then I can have no peace.&nbsp; Good-night,
etc., and pity Presto.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Mr. Harley was restless last night; but he has no
fever, and the hopes of his mending increase.&nbsp; I had a
letter from Mr. Walls, and one from Mr. Bernage.&nbsp; I will
answer them here, not having time to write.&nbsp; Mr. Walls
writes about three things.&nbsp; First, about a hundred pounds
from Dr. Raymond, of which I hear nothing, and it is now too
late.&nbsp; Secondly, about Mr. Clements: <a
name="citation167a"></a><a href="#footnote167a"
class="citation">[167a]</a> I can do nothing in it, because I am
not to mention Mr. Pratt; and I cannot recommend without knowing
Mr. Pratt&rsquo;s objections, whose relation Clements is, and who
brought him into the place.&nbsp; The third is about my being
godfather to the child: <a name="citation167b"></a><a
href="#footnote167b" class="citation">[167b]</a> that is in my
power, and (since there is no remedy) will submit.&nbsp; I wish
you could hinder it; but if it can&rsquo;t be helped, pay what
you think proper, and get the Provost to stand for me, and let
his Christian name be Harley, in honour of my friend, now lying
stabbed and doubtful of his life.&nbsp; As for Bernage, he writes
me word that his colonel has offered to make him
captain-lieutenant for a hundred pounds.&nbsp; He was such a fool
to offer him money without writing to me till it was done, though
I have had a dozen letters from him; and then he desires I would
say nothing of this, for fear his colonel should be angry.&nbsp;
People are mad.&nbsp; What can I do?&nbsp; I engaged Colonel
Disney, who was one of his solicitors to the Secretary, and then
told him the story.&nbsp; He assured me that Fielding
(Bernage&rsquo;s colonel) said he might have got that sum; but,
on account <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>of those great recommendations he had, would give it
him for nothing: and I would have Bernage write him a letter of
thanks, as of a thing given him for nothing, upon
recommendations, etc.&nbsp; Disney tells me he will again speak
to Fielding, and clear up this matter; then I will write to
Bernage.&nbsp; A pox on him for promising money till I had it
promised to me; and then making it such a ticklish point, that
one cannot expostulate with the colonel upon it: but let him do
as I say, and there is an end.&nbsp; I engaged the Secretary of
State in it; and am sure it was meant a kindness to me, and that
no money should be given, and a hundred pounds is too much in a
Smithfield bargain, <a name="citation168a"></a><a
href="#footnote168a" class="citation">[168a]</a> as a
major-general told me, whose opinion I asked.&nbsp; I am now
hurried, and can say no more.&nbsp; Farewell, etc. etc.</p>
<p>How shall I superscribe to your new lodgings, pray,
madams?&nbsp; Tell me but that, impudence and saucy-face.</p>
<p>Are not you sauceboxes to write &ldquo;lele&rdquo; <a
name="citation168b"></a><a href="#footnote168b"
class="citation">[168b]</a> like Presto?&nbsp; O poor Presto!</p>
<p>Mr. Harley is better to-night, that makes me so pert, you
saucy Gog and Magog.</p>
<h3>LETTER XVIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>March</i> 10, 1710&ndash;11.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pretty</span> little MD must expect little
from me till Mr. Harley is out of danger.&nbsp; We hope he is so
now; but I am subject to fear for my friends.&nbsp; He has a head
full of the whole business of the nation, was out of order when
the villain stabbed him, and had a cruel contusion by the second
blow.&nbsp; But all goes on well yet.&nbsp; Mr. Ford and I dined
with Mr. Lewis, and we hope the best.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; This morning Mr. Secretary and I met at Court, where
<a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>he went
to the Queen, who is out of order, and aguish: I doubt the worse
for this accident to Mr. Harley.&nbsp; We went together to his
house, and his wound looks well, and he is not feverish at all,
and I think it is foolish in me to be so much in pain as I
am.&nbsp; I had the penknife in my hand, which is broken within a
quarter of an inch of the handle.&nbsp; I have a mind to write
and publish an account of all the particularities of this fact:
<a name="citation169a"></a><a href="#footnote169a"
class="citation">[169a]</a> it will be very curious, and I would
do it when Mr. Harley is past danger.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; We have been in terrible pain to-day about Mr.
Harley, who never slept last night, and has been very
feverish.&nbsp; But this evening I called there; and young Mr.
Harley (his only son) tells me he is now much better, and was
then asleep.&nbsp; They let nobody see him, and that is perfectly
right.&nbsp; The Parliament cannot go on till he is well, and are
forced to adjourn their money businesses, which none but he can
help them in.&nbsp; Pray God preserve him.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; Mr. Harley is better to-day, slept well all night,
and we are a little out of our fears.&nbsp; I send and call three
or four times every day.&nbsp; I went into the City for a walk,
and dined there with a private man; and coming home this evening,
broke my shin in the Strand over a tub of sand left just in the
way.&nbsp; I got home dirty enough, and went straight to bed,
where I have been cooking it with gold-beater&rsquo;s skin, and
have been peevish enough with Patrick, who was near an hour
bringing a rag from next door.&nbsp; It is my right shin, where
never any humour fell when t&rsquo;other used to swell; so I
apprehend it less: however, I shall not stir till &rsquo;tis
well, which I reckon will be in a week.&nbsp; I am very careful
in these sort of things; but I wish I had Mrs. J&mdash;&rsquo;s
water: <a name="citation169b"></a><a href="#footnote169b"
class="citation">[169b]</a> she is out of town, and I must make a
shift with alum.&nbsp; I will dine with Mrs. Vanhomrigh till I am
well, who lives but five doors off; and that I may venture.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; My journals are like to be very diverting, now I
cannot <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>stir abroad, between accounts of Mr. Harley&rsquo;s
mending, and of my broken shin.&nbsp; I just walked to my
neighbour Vanhomrigh at two, and came away at six, when little
Harrison the Tatler came to me, and begged me to dictate a paper
to him, which I was forced in charity to do.&nbsp; Mr. Harley
still mends; and I hope in a day or two to trouble you no more
with him, nor with my shin.&nbsp; Go to bed and sleep, sirrahs,
that you may rise to-morrow and walk to Donnybrook, and lose your
money with Stoyte and the Dean; do so, dear little rogues, and
drink Presto&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; O pray, don&rsquo;t you drink
Presto&rsquo;s health sometimes with your deans, and your
Stoytes, and your Walls, and your Manleys, and your everybodies,
pray now?&nbsp; I drink MD&rsquo;s to myself a hundred thousand
times.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; I was this morning at Mr. Secretary St. John&rsquo;s
for all my shin; and he has given me for young Harrison the
Tatler the prettiest employment in Europe; secretary to my Lord
Raby, <a name="citation170a"></a><a href="#footnote170a"
class="citation">[170a]</a> who is to be Ambassador Extraordinary
at the Hague, where all the great affairs will be concerted; so
we shall lose the <i>Tatlers</i> in a fortnight.&nbsp; I will
send Harrison to-morrow morning to thank the Secretary.&nbsp;
Poor Biddy Floyd <a name="citation170b"></a><a
href="#footnote170b" class="citation">[170b]</a> has got the
smallpox.&nbsp; I called this morning to see Lady Betty Germaine,
and when she told me so, I fairly took my leave.&nbsp; I have the
luck of it; <a name="citation170c"></a><a href="#footnote170c"
class="citation">[170c]</a> for about ten days ago I was to see
Lord Carteret; <a name="citation170d"></a><a href="#footnote170d"
class="citation">[170d]</a> and my lady was entertaining me with
telling of a young lady, a cousin, who was then ill in the house
of the smallpox, and is since dead: it was near Lady
Betty&rsquo;s, and I fancy Biddy took the fright by it.&nbsp; I
dined <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>with Mr. Secretary; and a physician came in just from
Guiscard, who tells us he is dying of his wounds, and can hardly
live till to-morrow.&nbsp; A poor wench that Guiscard kept, sent
him a bottle of sack; but the keeper would not let him touch it,
for fear it was poison.&nbsp; He had two quarts of old clotted
blood come out of his side to-day, and is delirious.&nbsp; I am
sorry he is dying; for they had found out a way to hang
him.&nbsp; He certainly had an intention to murder the Queen.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; I have made but little progress in this letter for
so many days, thanks to Guiscard and Mr. Harley; and it would be
endless to tell you all the particulars of that odious
fact.&nbsp; I do not yet hear that Guiscard is dead, but they say
&rsquo;tis impossible he should recover.&nbsp; I walked too much
yesterday for a man with a broken shin; to-day I rested, and went
no farther than Mrs. Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s, where I dined; and Lady
Betty Butler coming in about six, I was forced in good manners to
sit with her till nine; then I came home, and Mr. Ford came in to
visit my shin, and sat with me till eleven: so I have been very
idle and naughty.&nbsp; It vexes me to the pluck <a
name="citation171a"></a><a href="#footnote171a"
class="citation">[171a]</a> that I should lose walking this
delicious day.&nbsp; Have you seen the <i>Spectator</i> <a
name="citation171b"></a><a href="#footnote171b"
class="citation">[171b]</a> yet, a paper that comes out every
day?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis written by Mr. Steele, who seems to have
gathered new life, and have a new fund of wit; it is in the same
nature as his <i>Tatlers</i>, and they have all of them had
something pretty.&nbsp; I believe Addison and he club.&nbsp; I
never see them; and I plainly told Mr. Harley and Mr. St. John,
ten days ago, before my Lord Keeper and Lord Rivers, that I had
been foolish enough to spend my credit with them in favour of
Addison and Steele; but that I would engage and promise never to
say one word in their behalf, having been used so ill for what I
had already done.&mdash;So, now I am got into the way of prating
again, there will be no quiet for me.</p>
<p class="poetry">When Presto begins to prate,<br />
Give him a rap upon the pate.</p>
<p>O Lord, how I blot! it is time to leave off, etc.</p>
<p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>17.&nbsp; Guiscard died this morning at two; and the
coroner&rsquo;s inquest have found that he was killed by bruises
received from a messenger, so to clear the Cabinet Councillors
from whom he received his wounds.&nbsp; I had a letter from
Raymond, who cannot hear of your box; but I hope you have it
before this comes to your hands.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Mr.
Lewis of the Secretary&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; Mr. Harley has
abundance of extravasated blood comes from his breast out of his
wound, and will not be well so soon as we expected.&nbsp; I had
something to say, but cannot call it to mind.&nbsp; (What was
it?)</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; I was to-day at Court to look for the Duke of
Argyle, and gave him the memorial about Bernage.&nbsp; The Duke
goes with the first fair wind.&nbsp; I could not find him, but I
have given the memorial to another to give him; and, however, it
shall be sent after him.&nbsp; Bernage has made a blunder in
offering money to his colonel without my advice; however, he is
made captain-lieutenant, only he must recruit the company, which
will cost him forty pounds, and that is cheaper than an
hundred.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Mr. Secretary St. John, and
stayed till seven, but would not drink his champagne and
burgundy, for fear of the gout.&nbsp; My shin mends, but is not
well.&nbsp; I hope it will by the time I send this letter, next
Saturday.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; I went to-day into the City, but in a coach, and
sossed <a name="citation172a"></a><a href="#footnote172a"
class="citation">[172a]</a> up my leg on the seat; and as I came
home, I went to see poor Charles Barnard&rsquo;s <a
name="citation172b"></a><a href="#footnote172b"
class="citation">[172b]</a> books, which are to be sold by
auction, and I itch to lay out nine or ten pounds for some fine
editions of fine authors.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis too far, and I
shall let it slip, as I usually do all such opportunities.&nbsp;
I dined in a coffee-house with Stratford upon chops and some of
his wine.&nbsp; Where did MD dine?&nbsp; Why, poor MD dined at
home to-day, because of the Archbishop, and they could not go
abroad, and had a breast of mutton and a pint of wine.&nbsp; I
hope Mrs. Walls mends; and pray give me an account what sort of
godfather I made, and whether I behaved myself handsomely.&nbsp;
<a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>The Duke
of Argyle is gone; and whether he has my memorial, I know not,
till I see Dr. Arbuthnot, <a name="citation173a"></a><a
href="#footnote173a" class="citation">[173a]</a> to whom I gave
it.&nbsp; That hard name belongs to a Scotch doctor, an
acquaintance of the Duke&rsquo;s and me; Stella can&rsquo;t
pronounce it.&nbsp; Oh that we were at Laracor this fine day! the
willows begin to peep, and the quicks to bud.&nbsp; My dream is
out: I was a-dreamed last night that I ate ripe
cherries.&mdash;And now they begin to catch the pikes, and will
shortly the trouts (pox on these Ministers!)&mdash;and I would
fain know whether the floods were ever so high as to get over the
holly bank or the river walk; if so, then all my pikes are gone;
but I hope not.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you ask Parvisol these
things, sirrahs?&nbsp; And then my canal, and trouts, and whether
the bottom be fine and clear?&nbsp; But harkee, ought not
Parvisol to pay in my last year&rsquo;s rents and arrears out of
his hands?&nbsp; I am thinking, if either of you have heads to
take his accounts, it should be paid in to you; otherwise to Mr.
Walls.&nbsp; I will write an order on t&rsquo;other side; and do
as you will.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a world of business; but I must
go sleep, I&rsquo;m drowsy; and so good-night, etc.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; This sore shin ruins me in coach-hire; no less than
two shillings to-day going and coming from the City, where I
dined with one you never heard of, and passed an insipid
day.&nbsp; I writ this post to Bernage, with the account I told
you above.&nbsp; I hope he will like it; &rsquo;tis his own
fault, or it would have been better.&nbsp; I reckon your next
letter will be full of Mr. Harley&rsquo;s stabbing.&nbsp; He
still mends, but abundance of extravasated blood has come out of
the wound: he keeps his bed, and sees nobody.&nbsp; The
Speaker&rsquo;s eldest son <a name="citation173b"></a><a
href="#footnote173b" class="citation">[173b]</a> is just dead of
the smallpox, and the House is adjourned a week, to <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>give him
time to wipe off his tears.&nbsp; I think it very handsomely
done; but I believe one reason is, that they want Mr. Harley so
much.&nbsp; Biddy Floyd is like to do well: and so go to your
Dean&rsquo;s, and roast his oranges, and lose your money, do so,
you saucy sluts.&nbsp; Stella, you lost three shillings and
fourpence t&rsquo;other night at Stoyte&rsquo;s, yes, you did,
and Presto stood in a corner, and saw you all the while, and then
stole away.&nbsp; I dream very often I am in Ireland, and that I
have left my clothes and things behind me, and have not taken
leave of anybody; and that the Ministry expect me to-morrow, and
such nonsense.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; I would not for a guinea have a letter from you till
this goes; and go it shall on Saturday, faith.&nbsp; I dined with
Mrs. Vanhomrigh, to save my shin, and then went on some business
to the Secretary, and he was not at home.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; Yesterday was a short day&rsquo;s journal: but what
care I? what cares saucy Presto?&nbsp; Darteneuf <a
name="citation174a"></a><a href="#footnote174a"
class="citation">[174a]</a> invited me to dinner to-day.&nbsp; Do
not you know Darteneuf?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the man that knows
everything, and that everybody knows; and that knows where a knot
of rabble are going on a holiday, and when they were there last:
and then I went to the Coffee-house.&nbsp; My shin mends, but is
not quite healed: I ought to keep it up, but I don&rsquo;t; I
e&rsquo;en let it go as it comes.&nbsp; Pox take Parvisol and his
watch!&nbsp; If I do not receive the ten-pound bill I am to get
towards it, I will neither receive watch nor chain; so let
Parvisol know.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; I this day appointed the Duke of Ormond to meet him
at Ned Southwell&rsquo;s, about an affair of printing Irish
Prayer-Books, etc., <a name="citation174b"></a><a
href="#footnote174b" class="citation">[174b]</a> but the Duke
never came.&nbsp; There Southwell had letters that two packets
are taken; so if MD writ then, the letters are gone; for they are
packets coming hither.&nbsp; Mr. Harley is not yet well, but his
extravasated blood continues, and I doubt he will not be quite
well in a good while: I find you have heard of the fact by
Southwell&rsquo;s letters from Ireland: what do you think of
it?&nbsp; I dined with <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>Sir John Perceval, <a
name="citation175a"></a><a href="#footnote175a"
class="citation">[175a]</a> and saw his lady sitting in the bed,
in the forms of a lying-in woman; and coming home my sore shin
itched, and I forgot what it was, and rubbed off the scab, and
blood came; but I am now got into bed, and have put on alum curd,
and it is almost well.&nbsp; Lord Rivers told me yesterday a
piece of bad news, as a secret, that the Pretender is going to be
married to the Duke of Savoy&rsquo;s daughter. <a
name="citation175b"></a><a href="#footnote175b"
class="citation">[175b]</a>&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very bad if it be
true.&nbsp; We were walking in the Mall with some Scotch lords,
and he could not tell it until they were gone, and he bade me
tell it to none but the Secretary of State and MD.&nbsp; This
goes to-morrow, and I have no room but to bid my dearest little
MD good-night.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; I will now seal up this letter, and send it; for I
reckon to have none from you (&rsquo;tis morning now) between
this and night; and I will put it in the post with my own
hands.&nbsp; I am going out in great haste; so farewell, etc.</p>
<h3>LETTER XIX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>March</i> 24, 1710&ndash;11.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a little cross in Presto not
to send to-day to the Coffee-house to see whether there was a
letter from MD before I sent away mine; but, faith, I did it on
purpose, because I would scorn to answer two letters of yours
successively.&nbsp; This way of journal is the worst in the world
for writing of news, unless one does it the last day; and so I
will observe henceforward, if there be any politics or stuff
worth sending.&nbsp; My shin mends in spite of the scratching
last night.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Ned Southwell&rsquo;s with
the <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>Bishop of Ossory <a name="citation176a"></a><a
href="#footnote176a" class="citation">[176a]</a> and a parcel of
Irish gentlemen.&nbsp; Have you yet seen any of the
<i>Spectators</i>?&nbsp; Just three weeks to-day since I had your
last, N. 11.&nbsp; I am afraid I have lost one by the packet that
was taken; that will vex me, considering the pains MD take to
write, especially poor pretty Stella, and her weak eyes.&nbsp;
God bless them and the owner, and send them well, and little me
together, I hope ere long.&nbsp; This illness of Mr. Harley puts
everything backwards, and he is still down, and like to be so, by
that extravasated blood which comes from his breast to the wound:
it was by the second blow Guiscard gave him after the penknife
was broken.&nbsp; I am shocked at that villainy whenever I think
of it.&nbsp; Biddy Floyd is past danger, but will lose all her
beauty: she had them mighty thick, especially about her nose.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I wish you a merry New Year; this is
the first day of the year, you know, with us, and &rsquo;tis
Lady-day.&nbsp; I must rise and go to my Lord Keeper: it is not
shaving-day to-day, so I shall be early.&nbsp; I am to dine with
Mr. Secretary St. John.&nbsp; Good-morrow, my mistresses both,
good-morrow.&nbsp; Stella will be peeping out of her room at Mrs.
De Caudres&rsquo; <a name="citation176b"></a><a
href="#footnote176b" class="citation">[176b]</a> down upon the
folks as they come from church; and there comes Mrs. Proby, <a
name="citation176c"></a><a href="#footnote176c"
class="citation">[176c]</a> and that is my Lady Southwell, <a
name="citation176d"></a><a href="#footnote176d"
class="citation">[176d]</a> and there is Lady Betty Rochfort. <a
name="citation176e"></a><a href="#footnote176e"
class="citation">[176e]</a>&nbsp; I long to hear how you are <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>settled in
your new lodgings.&nbsp; I wish I were rid of my old ones, and
that Mrs. Brent could contrive to put up my books in boxes, and
lodge them in some safe place, and you keep my papers of
importance.&nbsp; But I must rise, I tell you.&mdash;At
night.&nbsp; So I visited and dined as I told you, and what of
that?&nbsp; We have let Guiscard be buried at last, after showing
him pickled in a trough this fortnight for twopence apiece: and
the fellow that showed would point to his body, and, &ldquo;See,
gentlemen, this is the wound that was given him by his Grace the
Duke of Ormond; and this is the wound,&rdquo; etc., and then the
show was over, and another set of rabble came in.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis hard our laws would not suffer us to hang his body in
chains, because he was not tried; and in the eye of our law every
man is innocent till then.&mdash;Mr. Harley is still very weak,
and never out of bed.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; This was a most delicious day; and my shin being
past danger, I walked like lightning above two hours in the
Park.&nbsp; We have generally one fair day, and then a great deal
of rain for three or four days together.&nbsp; All things are at
a stop in Parliament for want of Mr. Harley; they cannot stir an
inch without him in their most material affairs: and we fear, by
the caprice of Radcliffe, who will admit none but his own
surgeon, <a name="citation177"></a><a href="#footnote177"
class="citation">[177]</a> he has not been well looked
after.&nbsp; I dined at an alehouse with Mr. Lewis, but had his
wine.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you begin to see the flowers and blossoms
of the field?&nbsp; How busy should I be now at Laracor!&nbsp; No
news of your box?&nbsp; I hope you have it, and are this minute
drinking the chocolate, and that the smell of the Brazil tobacco
has not affected it.&nbsp; I would be glad to know whether you
like it, because I would send you more by people that are now
every day thinking of going to Ireland; therefore pray tell me,
and tell me soon: and I will have the strong box.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; A rainy, wretched, scurvy day from morning till
night: <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>and my neighbour Vanhomrigh invited me to dine with
them and this evening I passed at Mr. Prior&rsquo;s with Dr.
Freind; and &rsquo;tis now past twelve, so I must go sleep.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; O, faith, you&rsquo;re an impudent
saucy couple of sluttikins for presuming to write so soon, said I
to myself this morning; who knows but there may be a letter from
MD at the Coffee-house?&nbsp; Well, you must know, and so, I just
now sent Patrick, and he brought me three letters, but not one
from MD, no indeed, for I read all the superscriptions; and not
one from MD.&nbsp; One I opened, it was from the Archbishop; <a
name="citation178a"></a><a href="#footnote178a"
class="citation">[178a]</a> t&rsquo;other I opened, it was from
Staunton; <a name="citation178b"></a><a href="#footnote178b"
class="citation">[178b]</a> the third I took, and looked at the
hand.&nbsp; Whose hand is this? says I; yes, says I, whose hand
is this?&nbsp; Then there was wax between the folds; then I began
to suspect; then I peeped; faith, it was Walls&rsquo;s hand after
all: then I opened it in a rage, and then it was little
MD&rsquo;s hand, dear, little, pretty, charming MD&rsquo;s sweet
hand again.&nbsp; O Lord, an&rsquo;t here a clutter and a stir,
and a bustle? never saw the like.&nbsp; Faith, I believe yours
lay some days at the post-office, and that it came before my
eighteenth went, but that I did not expect it, and I hardly ever
go there.&nbsp; Well, and so you think I&rsquo;ll answer this
letter now; no, faith, and so I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
make you wait, young women; but I&rsquo;ll inquire immediately
about poor Dingley&rsquo;s exchequer trangum. <a
name="citation178c"></a><a href="#footnote178c"
class="citation">[178c]</a>&nbsp; What, is that Vedel again a
soldier? was he broke?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll put it in Ben
Tooke&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; I hope Vedel could not sell
it.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; Vedel, Vedel, poh, pox, I think it is
Vedeau; <a name="citation178d"></a><a href="#footnote178d"
class="citation">[178d]</a> ay, Vedeau, now I have it; let me
see, do you name him in yours?&nbsp; Yes, Mr. John Vedeau is the
brother; but where does this brother live?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
inquire.&nbsp; This was a fast-day for the public; so I dined
late with Sir Matthew Dudley, whom I have not been with a <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>great
while.&nbsp; He is one of those that must lose his employment
whenever the great shake comes; and I can&rsquo;t contribute to
keep him in, though I have dropped words in his favour to the
Ministry; but he is too violent a Whig, and friend to the Lord
Treasurer, <a name="citation179a"></a><a href="#footnote179a"
class="citation">[179a]</a> to stay in.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis odd to
think how long they let those people keep their places; but the
reason is, they have not enough to satisfy all expecters, and so
they keep them all in hopes, that they may be good boys in the
meantime; and thus the old ones hold in still.&nbsp; The
Comptroller <a name="citation179b"></a><a href="#footnote179b"
class="citation">[179b]</a> told me that there are eight people
expect his staff.&nbsp; I walked after dinner to-day round the
Park.&nbsp; What, do I write politics to little young
women?&nbsp; Hold your tongue, and go to your Dean&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; If this be a fine day, I will walk
into the City, and see Charles Barnard&rsquo;s library.&nbsp;
What care I for your letter, saucy N. 12?&nbsp; I will say
nothing to it yet: faith, I believe this will be full before its
time, and then go it must.&nbsp; I will always write once a
fortnight; and if it goes sooner by filling sooner, why, then
there is so much clear gain.&nbsp; Morrow, morrow, rogues and
lasses both, I can&rsquo;t lie scribbling here in bed for your
play; I must rise, and so morrow again.&mdash;At night.&nbsp;
Your friend Montgomery and his sister are here, as I am told by
Patrick.&nbsp; I have seen him often, but take no notice of him:
he is grown very ugly and pimpled.&nbsp; They tell me he is a
gamester, and wins money.&mdash;How could I help it, pray?&nbsp;
Patrick snuffed the candle too short, and the grease ran down
upon the paper. <a name="citation179c"></a><a
href="#footnote179c" class="citation">[179c]</a>&nbsp; It
an&rsquo;t my fault, &rsquo;tis Patrick&rsquo;s fault; pray now
don&rsquo;t blame Presto.&nbsp; I walked to-day in the City, and
dined at a private house, and went to see the auction of poor
Charles Barnard&rsquo;s books; they were in the middle of the
physic books, so I bought none; and they are so dear, I believe I
shall buy none, and there is an end; and go to Stoyte&rsquo;s,
and I&rsquo;ll go sleep.</p>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>30.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; This is Good Friday, you must
know; and I must rise and go to Mr. Secretary about some
business, and Mrs. Vanhomrigh desires me to breakfast with her,
because she is to intercede for Patrick, who is so often drunk
and quarrelsome in the house, that I was resolved to send him
over; but he knows all the places where I send, and is so used to
my ways, that it would be inconvenient to me; but when I come to
Ireland, I will discharge him. <a name="citation180a"></a><a
href="#footnote180a" class="citation">[180a]</a>&nbsp; Sir Thomas
Mansel, <a name="citation180b"></a><a href="#footnote180b"
class="citation">[180b]</a> one of the Lords of the Treasury,
setting me down at my door to-day, saw Patrick, and swore he was
a Teague-lander. <a name="citation180c"></a><a
href="#footnote180c" class="citation">[180c]</a>&nbsp; I am so
used to his face, I never observed it, but thought him a pretty
fellow.&nbsp; Sir Andrew Fountaine and I supped this fast-day
with Mrs. Vanhomrigh.&nbsp; We were afraid Mr. Harley&rsquo;s
wound would turn to a fistula; but we think the danger is now
past.&nbsp; He rises every day, and walks about his room, and we
hope he will be out in a fortnight.&nbsp; Prior showed me a
handsome paper of verses he has writ on Mr. Harley&rsquo;s
accident: <a name="citation180d"></a><a href="#footnote180d"
class="citation">[180d]</a> they are not out; I will send them to
you, if he will give me a copy.</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; What shall we do to make April fools
this year, now it happens on Sunday?&nbsp; Patrick brings word
that Mr. Harley still mends, and is up every day.&nbsp; I design
to see him in a few days: and he brings me word too that he has
found out Vedeau&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s shop: I shall call there
in a day or two.&nbsp; It seems the wife lodges next door to the
brother.&nbsp; I doubt the scoundrel was broke, and got a
commission, or perhaps is a volunteer gentleman, and expects to
get one by his valour.&nbsp; Morrow, sirrahs, let me
rise.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Sir Thomas
Mansel.&nbsp; We were walking in the Park, and Mr. Lewis came to
us.&nbsp; Mansel asked where we dined.&nbsp; We said,
&ldquo;Together.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said, we should dine <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>with him,
only his wife <a name="citation181a"></a><a href="#footnote181a"
class="citation">[181a]</a> desired him to bring nobody, because
she had only a leg of mutton.&nbsp; I said I would dine with him
to choose; but he would send a servant to order a plate or two:
yet this man has ten thousand pounds a year in land, and is a
Lord of the Treasury, and is not covetous neither, but runs out
merely by slattering <a name="citation181b"></a><a
href="#footnote181b" class="citation">[181b]</a> and
negligence.&nbsp; The worst dinner I ever saw at the Dean&rsquo;s
was better: but so it is with abundance of people here.&nbsp; I
called at night at Mr. Harley&rsquo;s, who begins to walk in his
room with a stick, but is mighty weak.&mdash;See how much I have
lost with that ugly grease. <a name="citation181c"></a><a
href="#footnote181c" class="citation">[181c]</a>&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
your fault, pray; and I&rsquo;ll go to bed.</p>
<p>April 1.&nbsp; The Duke of Buckingham&rsquo;s house fell down
last night with an earthquake, and is half swallowed up;
won&rsquo;t you go and see it?&mdash;An April fool, an April
fool, oh ho, young women.&nbsp; Well, don&rsquo;t be angry.&nbsp;
I will make you an April fool no more till the next time; we had
no sport here, because it is Sunday, and Easter Sunday.&nbsp; I
dined with the Secretary, who seemed terribly down and
melancholy, which Mr. Prior and Lewis observed as well as I:
perhaps something is gone wrong; perhaps there is nothing in
it.&nbsp; God bless my own dearest MD, and all is well.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; We have such windy weather, &rsquo;tis troublesome
walking, yet all the rabble have got into our Park these Easter
holidays.&nbsp; I am plagued with one Richardson, an Irish
parson, and his project of printing Irish Bibles, etc., to make
you Christians in that country: I befriend him what I can, on
account of the Archbishop and Bishop of Clogher.&mdash;But what
business have I to meddle, etc.&nbsp; Do not you remember that,
sirrah Stella? what was that about, when you thought I was
meddling with something that was not my business?&nbsp; O, faith,
you are an impudent slut, I remember your doings, I&rsquo;ll
never forget you as long as I live.&nbsp; Lewis and I dined
together at his lodgings.&nbsp; But where&rsquo;s the answer to
this <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>letter of MD&rsquo;s?&nbsp; O, faith, Presto, you must
think of that.&nbsp; Time enough, says saucy Presto.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I was this morning to see Mrs. Barton: I love her
better than anybody here, and see her seldomer.&nbsp; Why, really
now, so it often happens in the world, that where one loves a
body best&mdash;pshah, pshah, you are so silly with your moral
observations.&nbsp; Well, but she told me a very good
story.&nbsp; An old gentlewoman died here two months ago, and
left in her will, to have eight men and eight maids bearers, who
should have two guineas apiece, ten guineas to the parson for a
sermon, and two guineas to the clerk.&nbsp; But bearers, parson,
and clerk must be all true virgins; and not to be admitted till
they took their oaths of virginity: so the poor woman still lies
unburied, and so must do till the general resurrection.&mdash;I
called at Mr. Secretary&rsquo;s, to see what the D&mdash; ailed
him on Sunday.&nbsp; I made him a very proper speech; told him I
observed he was much out of temper; that I did not expect he
would tell me the cause, but would be glad to see he was in
better; and one thing I warned him of, never to appear cold to
me, for I would not be treated like a schoolboy; that I had felt
too much of that in my life already (meaning from Sir William
Temple); that I expected every great Minister who honoured me
with his acquaintance, if he heard or saw anything to my
disadvantage, would let me know it in plain words, and not put me
in pain to guess by the change or coldness of his countenance or
behaviour; for it was what I would hardly bear from a crowned
head, and I thought no subject&rsquo;s favour was worth it; and
that I designed to let my Lord Keeper <a
name="citation182a"></a><a href="#footnote182a"
class="citation">[182a]</a> and Mr. Harley know the same thing,
that they might use me accordingly.&nbsp; He took all right; said
I had reason; vowed nothing ailed him but sitting up whole nights
at business, and one night at drinking; would have had me dine
with him and Mrs. Masham&rsquo;s brother, to make up matters; but
I would not.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know, but I would not.&nbsp; But
indeed I was engaged with my old friend Rollinson; <a
name="citation182b"></a><a href="#footnote182b"
class="citation">[182b]</a> you never heard of him before.</p>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>4.&nbsp; I sometimes look a line or two back, and see
plaguy mistakes of the pen; how do you get over them?&nbsp; You
are puzzled sometimes.&nbsp; Why, I think what I said to Mr.
Secretary was right.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember how I used to
be in pain when Sir William Temple would look cold and out of
humour for three or four days, and I used to suspect a hundred
reasons?&nbsp; I have plucked up my spirit since then, faith; he
spoilt a fine gentleman.&nbsp; I dined with my neighbour
Vanhomrigh, and MD, poor MD, at home on a loin of mutton and half
a pint of wine, and the mutton was raw, poor Stella could not
eat, poor dear rogue, and Dingley was so vexed; but we will dine
at Stoyte&rsquo;s to-morrow.&nbsp; Mr. Harley promised to see me
in a day or two, so I called this evening; but his son and others
were abroad, and he asleep, so I came away, and found out Mrs.
Vedeau.&nbsp; She drew out a letter from Dingley, and said she
would get a friend to receive the money.&nbsp; I told her I would
employ Mr. Tooke in it henceforward.&nbsp; Her husband bought a
lieutenancy of foot, and is gone to Portugal.&nbsp; He sold his
share of the shop to his brother, and put out the money to
maintain her, all but what bought the commission.&nbsp; She
lodges within two doors of her brother.&nbsp; She told me it made
her very melancholy to change her manner of life thus, but trade
was dead, etc.&nbsp; She says she will write to you soon.&nbsp; I
design to engage Ben Tooke, and then receive the parchment from
her.&mdash;I gave Mr. Dopping a copy of Prior&rsquo;s verses on
Mr. Harley; he sent them yesterday to Ireland, so go look for
them, for I won&rsquo;t be at the trouble to transcribe them
here.&nbsp; They will be printed in a day or two.&nbsp; Give my
hearty service to Stoyte and Catherine: upon my word I love them
dearly, and desire you will tell them so: pray desire Goody
Stoyte not to let Mrs. Walls and Mrs. Johnson cheat her of her
money at ombre, but assure her from me that she is a
bungler.&nbsp; Dine with her to-day, and tell her so, and drink
my health, and good voyage, and speedy return, and so
you&rsquo;re a rogue.</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>5.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Now let us proceed to examine a
saucy letter from one Madam MD.&mdash;God Almighty bless poor
dear Stella, and send her a great many birthdays, all happy, and
healthy, and wealthy, and with me ever together, and never
asunder again, unless by chance.&nbsp; When I find you are happy
or merry there, it makes me so here, and I can hardly imagine you
absent when I am reading your letter, or writing to you.&nbsp;
No, faith, you are just here upon this little paper, and
therefore I see and talk with you every evening constantly, and
sometimes in the morning, but not always in the morning, because
that is not so modest to young ladies.&mdash;What, you would fain
palm a letter on me more than you sent: and I, like a fool, must
look over all yours, to see whether this was really N. 12, or
more.&nbsp; [Patrick has this moment brought me letters from the
Bishop of Clogher and Parvisol; my heart was at my mouth for fear
of one from MD; what a disgrace would it be to have two of yours
to answer together!&nbsp; But, faith, this shall go to-night, for
fear; and then come when it will, I defy it.]&nbsp; No, you are
not naughty at all, write when you are disposed.&nbsp; And so the
Dean told you the story of Mr. Harley from the Archbishop; I
warrant it never spoiled your supper, or broke off your
game.&nbsp; Nor yet, have not you the box?&nbsp; I wish Mrs.
Edgworth had the &mdash;.&nbsp; But you have it now, I suppose;
and is the chocolate good, or has the tobacco spoilt it?&nbsp;
Leigh stays till Sterne has done his business, no longer; and
when that will be, God knows: I befriend him as much as I can,
but Harley&rsquo;s accident stops that as well as all things
else.&nbsp; You guess, Madam Dingley, that I shall stay a round
twelvemonth; as hope saved, I would come over, if I could, this
minute; but we will talk of that by and by. Your affair of Vedeau
I have told you of already; now to the next, turn over the
leaf.&nbsp; Mrs. Dobbins lies, I have no more provision here or
in Ireland than I had.&nbsp; I am pleased that Stella the
conjurer approves what I did with Mr. Harley; <a
name="citation184"></a><a href="#footnote184"
class="citation">[184]</a> but your generosity makes me mad; I
know you repine inwardly at Presto&rsquo;s absence; you think he
has broken his <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>word of coming in three months, and that this is always
his trick; and now Stella says she does not see possibly how I
can come away in haste, and that MD is satisfied, etc.&nbsp;
An&rsquo;t you a rogue to overpower me thus?&nbsp; I did not
expect to find such friends as I have done.&nbsp; They may indeed
deceive me too.&nbsp; But there are important reasons [Pox on
this grease, this candle tallow!] why they should not. <a
name="citation185a"></a><a href="#footnote185a"
class="citation">[185a]</a>&nbsp; I have been used barbarously by
the late Ministry; I am a little piqued in honour to let people
see I am not to be despised.&nbsp; The assurances they give me,
without any scruple or provocation, are such as are usually
believed in the world; they may come to nothing, but the first
opportunity that offers, and is neglected, I shall depend no
more, but come away.&nbsp; I could say a thousand things on this
head, if I were with you.&nbsp; I am thinking why Stella should
not go to the Bath, if she be told it will do her good.&nbsp; I
will make Parvisol get up fifty pounds, and pay it you; and you
may be good housewives, and live cheap there some months, and
return in autumn, or visit London, as you please: pray think of
it.&nbsp; I writ to Bernage, directed to Curry&rsquo;s; I wish he
had the letter.&nbsp; I will send the bohea tea, if I can.&nbsp;
The Bishop of Kilmore, <a name="citation185b"></a><a
href="#footnote185b" class="citation">[185b]</a> I don&rsquo;t
keep such company; an old dying fool whom I never was with in my
life.&nbsp; So I am no godfather; <a name="citation185c"></a><a
href="#footnote185c" class="citation">[185c]</a> all the
better.&nbsp; Pray, Stella, explain those two words of yours to
me, what you mean by <i>villian</i> and <i>dainger</i>; <a
name="citation185d"></a><a href="#footnote185d"
class="citation">[185d]</a> and you, Madam Dingley, what is
<i>christianing</i>?&mdash;Lay your letter <i>this way</i>,
<i>this way</i>, and the devil a bit of difference between this
way and the other way.&nbsp; No; I will show you, lay them
<i>this way</i>, <i>this way</i>, and not <i>that way</i>,
<i>that way</i>. <a name="citation185e"></a><a
href="#footnote185e" class="citation">[185e]</a>&mdash;You shall
have your aprons; and I will put all your commissions as they
come, in a paper together, and do not think I will forget
MD&rsquo;s orders, because they are friends; I will be as careful
as if they were <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>strangers.&nbsp; I knew not what to do about this
Clements. <a name="citation186a"></a><a href="#footnote186a"
class="citation">[186a]</a>&nbsp; Walls will not let me say
anything as if Mr. Pratt was against him; and now the Bishop of
Clogher has written to me in his behalf.&nbsp; This thing does
not rightly fall in my way, and that people never consider: I
always give my good offices where they are proper, and that I am
judge of; however, I will do what I can.&nbsp; But, if he has the
name of a Whig, it will be hard, considering my Lord Anglesea and
Hyde <a name="citation186b"></a><a href="#footnote186b"
class="citation">[186b]</a> are very much otherwise, and you know
they have the employment of Deputy Treasurer.&nbsp; If the frolic
should take you of going to the Bath, I here send you a note on
Parvisol; if not, you may tear it, and there&rsquo;s an
end.&nbsp; Farewell.</p>
<p>If you have an imagination that the Bath will do you good, I
say again, I would have you go; if not, or it be inconvenient,
burn this note.&nbsp; Or, if you would go, and not take so much
money, take thirty pounds, and I will return you twenty from
hence.&nbsp; Do as you please, sirrahs.&nbsp; I suppose it will
not be too late for the first season; if it be, I would have you
resolve however to go the second season, if the doctors say it
will do you good, and you fancy so.</p>
<h3>LETTER XX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>April</i> 5, 1711.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">put</span> my nineteenth in the
post-office just now myself, as I came out of the City, where I
dined.&nbsp; This rain ruins me in coach-hire; I walked away
sixpennyworth, and came within a shilling length, and then took a
coach, <a name="citation186c"></a><a href="#footnote186c"
class="citation">[186c]</a> and got a lift back for nothing; and
am now busy.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary desired I would see him this morning;
said he had several things to say to me, and said not one; and
the Duke of Ormond sent to desire I would meet him at <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>Mr.
Southwell&rsquo;s by ten this morning too, which I did, thinking
it was some particular matter.&nbsp; All the Irish in town were
there, to consult upon preventing a Bill for laying a duty on
Irish yarn; so we talked a while, and then all went to the lobby
of the House of Commons, to solicit our friends, and the Duke
came among the rest; and Lord Anglesea solicited admirably, and I
did wonders.&nbsp; But, after all, the matter was put off till
Monday, and then we are to be at it again.&nbsp; I dined with
Lord Mountjoy, and looked over him at chess, which put me in mind
of Stella and Griffyth. <a name="citation187"></a><a
href="#footnote187" class="citation">[187]</a>&nbsp; I came home,
and that dog Patrick was not within; so I fretted, and fretted,
and what good did that do me?</p>
<p class="poetry">And so get you gone to your deans,<br />
You couple of queans.</p>
<p>I cannot find rhyme to Walls and Stoyte.&mdash;Yes, yes,</p>
<p class="poetry">You expect Mrs. Walls,<br />
Be dressed when she calls,<br />
To carry you to Stoyte,<br />
Or else <i>honi soit</i>.</p>
<p>Henley told me that the Tories were insup-port-able people,
because they are for bringing in French claret, and will not
<i>sup-port</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Harley will hardly get abroad this
week or ten days yet.&nbsp; I reckon, when I send away this
letter, he will be just got into the House of Commons.&nbsp; My
last letter went in twelve days, and so perhaps may this.&nbsp;
No it won&rsquo;t, for those letters that go under a fortnight
are answers to one of yours, otherwise you must take the days as
they happen, some dry, some wet, some barren, some fruitful, some
merry, some insipid; some, etc.&mdash;I will write you word
exactly the first day I see young gooseberries, and pray observe
how much later you are.&nbsp; We have not had five fine days this
five weeks, but rain or wind.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a late spring they
say here.&mdash;Go to bed, you two dear saucy brats, and
don&rsquo;t keep me up all night.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Ford has been at Epsom, to avoid Good Friday and <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Easter
Sunday.&nbsp; He forced me to-day to dine with him; and tells me
there are letters from Ireland, giving an account of a great
indiscretion in the Archbishop of Dublin, who applied a story out
of Tacitus very reflectingly on Mr. Harley, and that twenty
people have written of it; I do not believe it yet. <a
name="citation188a"></a><a href="#footnote188a"
class="citation">[188a]</a>&nbsp; I called this evening to see
Mr. Secretary, who has been very ill with the gravel and pain in
his back, by burgundy and champagne, added to the sitting up all
night at business; I found him drinking tea while the rest were
at champagne, and was very glad of it.&nbsp; I have chid him so
severely that I hardly knew whether he would take it well: then I
went and sat an hour with Mrs. St. John, who is growing a great
favourite of mine; she goes to the Bath on Wednesday, for she is
much out of health, and has begged me to take care of the
Secretary.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Mr. Secretary St. John; he gave
me a letter to read, which was from the publisher of the
newspaper called the <i>Postboy</i>; <a
name="citation188b"></a><a href="#footnote188b"
class="citation">[188b]</a> in it there was a long copy of a
letter from Dublin, giving an account of what the Whigs said upon
Mr. Harley&rsquo;s being stabbed, and how much they abuse him and
Mr. Secretary St. John; and at the end there were half a dozen
lines, telling the story of the Archbishop of Dublin, and abusing
him horribly; this was to be printed on Tuesday.&nbsp; I told the
Secretary I would not suffer that about the Archbishop to be
printed, and so I crossed it out; and afterwards, to prevent all
danger, I made him give me the letter, and, upon further thought,
would let none of it be published: and I sent for the printer,
and told him so, and ordered him, in the Secretary&rsquo;s name,
to print <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>nothing reflecting on anybody in Ireland till he had
showed it me.&nbsp; Thus I have prevented a terrible scandal to
the Archbishop, by a piece of perfect good fortune.&nbsp; I will
let him know it by next post; and pray, if you pick it out, let
me know, and whether he is thankful for it; but say nothing.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; I was to-day at the House of Commons again about
their yarn, at Lord Anglesea&rsquo;s desire; but the business is
again put off till Monday.&nbsp; I dined with Sir John Stanley,
by an assignation I had made with Mr. St. John, and George
Granville, the Secretary at War; but they let in other company,
some ladies, and so we were not so easy as I intended.&nbsp; My
head is pretty tolerable, but every day I feel some little
disorders; I have left off snuff since Sunday, finding myself
much worse after taking a good deal at the
Secretary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I would not let him drink one drop of
champagne or burgundy without water, and in compliment I did so
myself.&nbsp; He is much better; but when he is well, he is like
Stella, and will not be governed.&nbsp; So go to your
Stoyte&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;ll go sleep.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; I have been visiting Lady Worsley and Mrs. Barton
to-day, and dined soberly with my friend Lewis.&nbsp; The Dauphin
is dead of an apoplexy; I wish he had lived till the finishing of
this letter, that it might be news to you.&nbsp; Duncombe, <a
name="citation189"></a><a href="#footnote189"
class="citation">[189]</a> the rich alderman, died to-day, and I
hear has left the Duke of Argyle, who married his niece, two
hundred thousand pounds; I hope it is true, for I love that Duke
mightily.&nbsp; I writ this evening to the Archbishop of Dublin,
about what I told you; and then went to take leave of poor Mrs.
St. John, who gave me strict charge to take care of the Secretary
in her absence; said she had none to trust but me; and the poor
creature&rsquo;s tears came fresh in her eyes.&nbsp; Before we
took leave, I was drawn in by the other ladies and Sir John
Stanley to raffle for a fan, with a pox; it was four guineas, and
we put in <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>seven shillings apiece, several raffling for absent
people; but I lost, and so missed an opportunity of showing my
gallantry to Mrs. St. John, whom I designed to have presented it
to if I had won.&nbsp; Is Dilly <a name="citation190a"></a><a
href="#footnote190a" class="citation">[190a]</a> gone to the
Bath?&nbsp; His face will whizz in the water; I suppose he will
write to us from thence, and will take London in his way
back.&mdash;The rabble will say, &ldquo;There goes a drunken
parson&rdquo;; and, which is worse, they will say true.&nbsp; Oh,
but you must know I carried Ford to dine with Mr. St. John last
Sunday, that he may brag, when he goes back, of dining with a
Secretary of State.&nbsp; The Secretary and I went away early,
and left him drinking with the rest, and he told me that two or
three of them were drunk.&nbsp; They talk of great promotions to
be made; that Mr. Harley is to be Lord Treasurer, and Lord
Poulett <a name="citation190b"></a><a href="#footnote190b"
class="citation">[190b]</a> Master of the Horse, etc., but they
are only conjecture.&nbsp; The Speaker is to make Mr. Harley a
compliment the first time he comes into the House, which I hope
will be in a week.&nbsp; He has had an ill surgeon, by the
caprice of that puppy Dr. Radcliffe, which has kept him back so
long; and yesterday he got a cold, but is better
to-day.&mdash;What! I think I am stark mad, to write so much in
one day to little saucy MD; here is a deal of stuff, indeed!
can&rsquo;t you bid those little dear rogues good-night, and let
them go sleep, Mr. Presto?&nbsp; When your tongue runs
there&rsquo;s no ho with you, pray.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Again at the lobby (like a lobcock) <a
name="citation190c"></a><a href="#footnote190c"
class="citation">[190c]</a> of the House of Commons, about your
Irish yarn, and again put off till Friday; and I and Patrick went
into the City by water, where I dined, and then I went to the
auction of Charles Barnard&rsquo;s books; but the good ones were
so monstrous dear, I could not reach them, so I laid out one
pound seven shillings but very indifferently, and came away, and
will go there no more.&nbsp; Henley would fain engage me to go
with Steele and Rowe, <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>etc., to an invitation at Sir
William Read&rsquo;s. <a name="citation191a"></a><a
href="#footnote191a" class="citation">[191a]</a>&nbsp; Surely you
have heard of him.&nbsp; He has been a mountebank, and is the
Queen&rsquo;s oculist; he makes admirable punch, and treats you
in gold vessels.&nbsp; But I am engaged, and will not go, neither
indeed am I fond of the jaunt.&nbsp; So good-night, and go
sleep.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; I went about noon to the Secretary, who is very ill
with a cold, and sometimes of the gravel, with his champagne,
etc.&nbsp; I scolded him like a dog, and he promises faithfully
more care for the future.&nbsp; To-day my Lord Anglesea, and Sir
Thomas Hammer, and Prior, and I dined, by appointment, with
Lieutenant-General Webb. <a name="citation191b"></a><a
href="#footnote191b" class="citation">[191b]</a>&nbsp; My lord
and I stayed till ten o&rsquo;clock; but we drank soberly, and I
always with water.&nbsp; There was with us one Mr. Campain, <a
name="citation191c"></a><a href="#footnote191c"
class="citation">[191c]</a> one of the October Club, if you know
what that is; a Club of country members, who think the Ministers
are too backward in punishing and turning out the Whigs.&nbsp; I
found my lord and the rest thought I had more credit with the
Ministry than I pretend to have, and would have engaged me to put
them upon something that would satisfy their desires, and indeed
I think they have some reason to complain; however, I will not
burn my fingers.&nbsp; I will remember Stella&rsquo;s chiding,
&ldquo;What had you to do with what did not belong to you?&rdquo;
etc.&nbsp; However, you will give me leave to tell the Ministry
my thoughts when they ask them, and other people&rsquo;s thoughts
sometimes when they do not ask; so thinks Dingley.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; I called this morning at Mrs. Vedeau&rsquo;s again,
who has employed a friend to get the money; it will be done in a
<a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>fortnight, and then she will deliver me up the
parchment.&nbsp; I went then to see Mr. Harley, who I hope will
be out in a few days; he was in excellent good humour, only
complained to me of the neglect of Guiscard&rsquo;s cure, how
glad he would have been to have had him live.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary
came in to us, and we were very merry till Lord Chamberlain (Duke
of Shrewsbury) <a name="citation192a"></a><a href="#footnote192a"
class="citation">[192a]</a> came up; then Colonel Masham and I
went off, after I had been presented to the Duke, and that we
made two or three silly compliments suitable to the
occasion.&nbsp; Then I attended at the House of Commons about
your yarn, and it is again put off.&nbsp; Then Ford drew me to
dine at a tavern; it happened to be the day and the house where
the October Club dine.&nbsp; After we had dined, coming down we
called to inquire whether our yarn business had been over that
day, and I sent into the room for Sir George Beaumont. <a
name="citation192b"></a><a href="#footnote192b"
class="citation">[192b]</a>&nbsp; But I had like to be drawn into
a difficulty; for in two minutes out comes Mr. Finch, <a
name="citation192c"></a><a href="#footnote192c"
class="citation">[192c]</a> Lord Guernsey&rsquo;s son, to let me
know that my Lord Compton, <a name="citation192d"></a><a
href="#footnote192d" class="citation">[192d]</a> the steward of
this feast, desired, in the name of the Club, that I would do
them the honour to dine with them.&nbsp; I sent my excuses,
adorned with about thirty compliments, and got off as fast as I
could.&nbsp; It would have been a most improper thing for me to
dine there, considering my friendship with the Ministry.&nbsp;
The Club is about a hundred and fifty, and near eighty of them
were then going to dinner at two long tables in a great
ground-room.&nbsp; At evening I went to the auction of
Barnard&rsquo;s books, and laid out three pounds three shillings,
but I&rsquo;ll go there no more; and so I said once before, but
now I&rsquo;ll keep to it.&nbsp; I forgot to tell that when I
dined at Webb&rsquo;s with Lord Anglesea, I spoke to him of
Clements, as one recommended for a very honest <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>gentleman
and good officer, and hoped he would keep him.&nbsp; He said he
had not thought otherwise, and that he should certainly hold his
place while he continued to deserve it; and I could not find
there had been any intentions from his lordship against
him.&nbsp; But I tell you, hunny, the impropriety of this.&nbsp;
A great man will do a favour for me, or for my friend; but why
should he do it for my friend&rsquo;s friend?&nbsp;
Recommendations should stop before they come to that.&nbsp; Let
any friend of mine recommend one of his to me for a thing in my
power, I will do it for his sake; but to speak to another for my
friend&rsquo;s friend is against all reason; and I desire you
will understand this, and discourage any such troubles given
me.&mdash;I hope this may do some good to Clements, it can do him
no hurt; and I find by Mrs. Pratt, <a name="citation193"></a><a
href="#footnote193" class="citation">[193]</a> that her husband
is his friend; and the Bishop of Clogher says Clements&rsquo;s
danger is not from Pratt, but from some other enemies, that think
him a Whig.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; I was so busy this morning that I did not go out
till late.&nbsp; I writ to-day to the Duke of Argyle, but said
nothing of Bernage, who, I believe, will not see him till Spain
is conquered, and that is, not at all.&nbsp; I was to-day at Lord
Shelburne&rsquo;s, and spoke to Mrs. Pratt again about Clements;
her husband himself wants some good offices, and I have done him
very good ones lately, and told Mrs. Pratt I expected her husband
should stand by Clements in return.&nbsp; Sir Andrew Fountaine
and I dined with neighbour Vanhomrigh; he is mighty ill of an
asthma, and apprehends himself in much danger; &rsquo;tis his own
fault, that will rake and drink, when he is but just crawled out
of his grave.&nbsp; I will send this letter just now, because I
think my half-year is out for my lodging; and, if you please, I
would be glad it were paid off, and some deal boxes made for my
books, and kept in some safe place.&nbsp; I would give something
for their keeping: but I doubt that lodging will not serve me
when I come back; I would have a larger place for books, and a
stable, if possible.&nbsp; So pray be so kind to pay the lodging,
and all accounts about it; and <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>get Mrs. Brent to put up my
things.&nbsp; I would have no books put in that trunk where my
papers are.&nbsp; If you do not think of going to the Bath, I
here send you a bill on Parvisol for twenty pounds Irish, out of
which you will pay for the lodging, and score the rest to
me.&nbsp; Do as you please, and love poor Presto, that loves MD
better than his life a thousand millions of times.&nbsp;
Farewell, MD, etc. etc.</p>

but nine days between the dates of my two former letters.&nbsp; I
sent away my twentieth this moment, and now am writing on like a
fish, as if nothing was done.&nbsp; But there was a cause for my
hasting away the last, for fear it should not come time enough
before a new quarter began.&nbsp; I told you where I dined
to-day; but forgot to tell you what I believe, that Mr. Harley
will be Lord Treasurer in a short time, and other great removes
and promotions made.&nbsp; This is my thought, etc.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; I was this morning with Mr. Secretary, and he is
grown pretty well.&nbsp; I dined with him to-day, and drank some
of that wine which the Duke of Tuscany used to send to Sir
William Temple: <a name="citation194"></a><a href="#footnote194"
class="citation">[194]</a> he always sends some to the chief
Ministers.&nbsp; I liked it mightily, but he does not; and he
ordered his butler to send me a chest of it to-morrow.&nbsp;
Would to God MD had it!&nbsp; The Queen is well again, and was at
chapel to-day, etc.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; I went with Ford into the City to-day, and dined
with Stratford, and drank Tokay, and then we went to the auction;
but I did not lay out above twelve shillings.&nbsp; My head is a
little out of order to-night, though no formal fit.&nbsp; My Lord
Keeper has sent to invite me to dinner to-morrow, and
you&rsquo;ll dine better with the Dean; and God bless you.&nbsp;
I forgot to <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>tell you that yesterday was sent me a <i>Narrative</i>
printed, with all the circumstances of Mr. Harley&rsquo;s
stabbing.&nbsp; I had not time to do it myself; so I sent my
hints to the author of the <i>Atalantis</i>, <a
name="citation195a"></a><a href="#footnote195a"
class="citation">[195a]</a> and she has cooked it into a sixpenny
pamphlet, in her own style, only the first page is left as I was
beginning it.&nbsp; But I was afraid of disobliging Mr. Harley or
Mr. St. John in one critical point about it, and so would not do
it myself.&nbsp; It is worth your reading, for the circumstances
are all true.&nbsp; My chest of Florence was sent me this
morning, and cost me seven and sixpence to two servants.&nbsp; I
would give two guineas you had it, etc.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; I was so out of order with my head this morning,
that I was going to send my excuses to my Lord Keeper; but
however I got up at eleven, and walked there after two, and
stayed till eight.&nbsp; There was Sir Thomas Mansel, Prior,
George Granville, and Mr. C&aelig;sar, <a
name="citation195b"></a><a href="#footnote195b"
class="citation">[195b]</a> and we were very merry.&nbsp; My head
is still wrong, but I have had no formal fit, only I totter a
little.&nbsp; I have left off snuff altogether.&nbsp; I have a
noble roll of tobacco for grating, very good.&nbsp; Shall I send
it to MD, if she likes that sort?&nbsp; My Lord Keeper and our
this day&rsquo;s company are to dine on Saturday with George
Granville, and to-morrow I dine with Lord Anglesea.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; Did you ever see such a blundering goosecap as
Presto?&nbsp; I saw the number 21 at top, and so I went on as if
it were the day of the month, whereas this is but Wednesday the
18th.&nbsp; How shall I do to blot and alter them?&nbsp; I have
made a shift to do it behind, but it is a great botch.&nbsp; I
dined with Lord Anglesea to-day, but did not go to the House of
Commons about the yarn; my head was not well enough.&nbsp; I know
not what is the matter; it has never been thus before: two days
together giddy from morning till night, but not with any violence
or pain; and I totter a little, but can make shift to walk.&nbsp;
I doubt I must fall to my pills again: I think of going into the
country a little way.&nbsp; I tell you what you <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>must do
henceforward: you must enclose your letter in a fair half-sheet
of paper, and direct the outside &ldquo;To Erasmus Lewis,
Esquire, at my Lord Dartmouth&rsquo;s office at Whitehall&rdquo;:
for I never go to the Coffee-house, and they will grudge to take
in my letters.&nbsp; I forgot to tell you that your mother was to
see me this morning, and brought me a flask of sweet-water for a
present, admirable for my head; but I shall not smell to
it.&nbsp; She is going to Sheen, with Lady Giffard: she would
fain send your papers over to you, or give them to me.&nbsp; Say
what you would have done, and it shall be done; because I love
Stella, and she is a good daughter, they say, and so is
Dingley.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; This morning General Webb was to give me a visit: he
goes with a crutch and stick, yet was forced to come up two pair
of stairs.&nbsp; I promised to dine with him, but afterwards sent
my excuses, and dined privately in my friend Lewis&rsquo;s
lodgings at Whitehall, with whom I had much business to talk of,
relating to the public and myself.&nbsp; Little Harrison the
Tatler goes to-morrow to the secretaryship I got him at the
Hague, and Mr. St. John has made him a present of fifty guineas
to bear his charges.&nbsp; An&rsquo;t I a good friend?&nbsp; Why
are not you a young fellow, that I might prefer you?&nbsp; I had
a letter from Bernage from Kinsale: he tells me his commission
for captain-lieutenant was ready for him at his arrival: so there
are two jackanapeses I have done with.&nbsp; My head is something
better this evening, though not well.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; I was this morning with Mr. Secretary, whose packets
were just come in, and among them a letter from Lord Peterborow
to me: he writes so well, I have no mind to answer him, and so
kind, that I must answer him.&nbsp; The Emperor&rsquo;s <a
name="citation196"></a><a href="#footnote196"
class="citation">[196]</a> death must, I think, cause great
alterations in Europe, and, I believe, will hasten a peace.&nbsp;
We reckon our King Charles will be chosen Emperor, and the Duke
of Savoy set up for Spain; but I believe he will make nothing of
it.&nbsp; <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>Dr. Freind and I dined in the City at a
printer&rsquo;s, and it has cost me two shillings in coach-hire,
and a great deal more this week and month, which has been almost
all rain, with now and then sunshine, and is the truest April
that I have known these many years.&nbsp; The lime-trees in the
Park are all out in leaves, though not large leaves yet.&nbsp;
Wise people are going into the country; but many think the
Parliament can hardly be up these six weeks.&nbsp; Mr. Harley was
with the Queen on Tuesday.&nbsp; I believe certainly he will be
Lord Treasurer: I have not seen him this week.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Lord Keeper, and I, and Prior, and
Sir Thomas Mansel, have appointed to dine this day with George
Granville.&nbsp; My head, I thank God, is better; but to be
giddyish three or four days together mortified me.&nbsp; I take
no snuff, and I will be very regular in eating little and the
gentlest meats.&nbsp; How does poor Stella just now, with her
deans and her Stoytes?&nbsp; Do they give you health for the
money you lose at ombre, sirrah?&nbsp; What say you to
that?&nbsp; Poor Dingley frets to see Stella lose that four and
elevenpence, the other night.&nbsp; Let us rise.&nbsp; Morrow,
sirrahs.&nbsp; I will rise, spite of your little teeth;
good-morrow.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; O, faith, you are little dear
saucyboxes.&nbsp; I was just going in the morning to tell you
that I began to want a letter from MD, and in four minutes after
Mr. Ford sends me one that he had picked up at St. James&rsquo;s
Coffee-house; for I go to no coffee-house at all.&nbsp; And,
faith, I was glad at heart to see it, and to see Stella so
brisk.&nbsp; O Lord, what pretending?&nbsp; Well, but I will not
answer it yet; I&rsquo;ll keep it for t&rsquo;other side.&nbsp;
Well, we dined to-day according to appointment: Lord Keeper went
away at near eight, I at eight, and I believe the rest will be
fairly fuddled; for young Harcourt, <a name="citation197"></a><a
href="#footnote197" class="citation">[197]</a> Lord
Keeper&rsquo;s son, began to prattle before I came away.&nbsp; It
will not do with Prior&rsquo;s lean carcass.&nbsp; I drink <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>little,
miss my glass often, put water in my wine, and go away before the
rest, which I take to be a good receipt for sobriety.&nbsp; Let
us put it into rhyme, and so make a proverb&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Drink little at a time;<br />
Put water with your wine;<br />
Miss your glass when you can;<br />
And go off the first man.</p>
<p>God be thanked, I am much better than I was, though something
of a totterer.&nbsp; I ate but little to-day, and of the gentlest
meat.&nbsp; I refused ham and pigeons, pease-soup, stewed beef,
cold salmon, because they were too strong.&nbsp; I take no snuff
at all, but some herb snuff prescribed by Dr. Radcliffe.</p>
<p class="poetry">Go to your deans,<br />
You couple of queans.</p>
<p>I believe I said that already.&nbsp; What care I? what cares
Presto?</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I must rise and go to the
Secretary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mr. Harley has been out of town this
week to refresh himself before he comes into Parliament.&nbsp;
Oh, but I must rise, so there is no more to be said; and so
morrow, sirrahs both.&mdash;Night.&nbsp; I dined to-day with the
Secretary, who has engaged me for every Sunday; and I was an hour
with him this morning deep in politics, where I told him the
objections of the October Club, and he answered all except one,
that no inquiries are made into past mismanagement.&nbsp; But
indeed I believe they are not yet able to make any: the late
Ministry were too cunning in their rogueries, and fenced
themselves with an Act of general pardon.&nbsp; I believe Mr.
Harley must be Lord Treasurer; yet he makes one difficulty which
is hard to answer: he must be made a lord, and his estate is not
large enough, and he is too generous to make it larger; and if
the Ministry should change soon by any accident, he will be left
in the suds.&nbsp; Another difficulty is, that if he be made a
peer, they will want him prodigiously in the House of Commons, of
which he is the great mover, and after him <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>the
Secretary, and hardly any else of weight.&nbsp; Two shillings
more to-day for coach and chair.&nbsp; I shall be ruined.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; So you expect an answer to your letter, do you
so?&nbsp; Yes, yes, you shall have an answer, you shall, young
women.&nbsp; I made a good pun on Saturday to my Lord
Keeper.&nbsp; After dinner we had coarse Doiley napkins, <a
name="citation199a"></a><a href="#footnote199a"
class="citation">[199a]</a> fringed at each end, upon the table,
to drink with: my Lord Keeper spread one of them between him and
Mr. Prior; I told him I was glad to see there was such a
fringeship [friendship] between Mr. Prior and his lordship.&nbsp;
Prior swore it was the worst he ever heard: I said I thought so
too; but at the same time I thought it was most like one of
Stella&rsquo;s that ever I heard.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord
Mountjoy, and this evening saw the Venetian Ambassador <a
name="citation199b"></a><a href="#footnote199b"
class="citation">[199b]</a> coming from his first public
audience.&nbsp; His coach was the most monstrous, huge, fine,
rich gilt thing that ever I saw.&nbsp; I loitered this evening,
and came home late.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; I was this morning to visit the Duchess of Ormond,
<a name="citation199c"></a><a href="#footnote199c"
class="citation">[199c]</a> who has long desired it, or
threatened she would not let me visit her daughters.&nbsp; I sat
an hour with her, and we were good company, when in came the
Countess of Bellamont, <a name="citation199d"></a><a
href="#footnote199d" class="citation">[199d]</a> with a
pox.&nbsp; I went out, and we did not know one another; yet
hearing me named, she asked, &ldquo;What, is that Dr.
Swift?&rdquo; said she and I were very well acquainted, and fell
a railing at me without mercy, as a lady told me that was there;
yet I never was but once in the company of that drab of a
Countess.&nbsp; Sir Andrew Fountaine and I dined with my
neighbour Van.&nbsp; I design in two days, if possible, to go
lodge at Chelsea for the air, and put myself under a necessity of
walking to and from London every day.&nbsp; I writ this post to
the Bishop of Clogher a long politic letter, to entertain <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>him.&nbsp;
I am to buy statues and harnese <a name="citation200a"></a><a
href="#footnote200a" class="citation">[200a]</a> for them, with a
vengeance.&nbsp; I have packed and sealed up MD&rsquo;s twelve
letters against I go to Chelsea.&nbsp; I have put the last
commissions of MD in my account-book; but if there be any former
ones, I have forgot them.&nbsp; I have Dingley&rsquo;s
pocket-book down, and Stella&rsquo;s green silk apron, and the
pound of tea; pray send me word if you have any other, and down
they shall go.&nbsp; I will not answer your letter yet, saucy
boxes.&nbsp; You are with the Dean just now, Madam Stella, losing
your money.&nbsp; Why do not you name what number you have
received?&nbsp; You say you have received my letters, but do not
tell the number.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; I was this day dining in the City with very
insignificant, low, and scurvy company.&nbsp; I had a letter from
the Archbishop of Dublin, with a long denial of the report raised
on him, <a name="citation200b"></a><a href="#footnote200b"
class="citation">[200b]</a> which yet has been since assured to
me from those who say they have it from the first hand; but I
cannot believe them.&nbsp; I will show it to the Secretary
to-morrow.&nbsp; I will not answer yours till I get to
Chelsea.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; Chelsea.&nbsp; I have sent two boxes of lumber to my
friend Darteneuf&rsquo;s house, and my chest of Florence and
other things to Mrs. Vanhomrigh, where I dined to-day.&nbsp; I
was this morning with the Secretary, and showed him the
Archbishop&rsquo;s letter, and convinced him of his Grace&rsquo;s
innocence, and I will do the same to Mr. Harley.&nbsp; I got here
in the stage-coach with Patrick and my portmanteau for sixpence,
and pay six shillings a week for one silly room with confounded
coarse sheets. <a name="citation200c"></a><a href="#footnote200c"
class="citation">[200c]</a>&nbsp; We have had such a horrible
deal of rain, that there is no walking to London, and I must go
as I came until it mends; and besides the whelp has taken my
lodging as far from London as this town <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>could
afford, at least half a mile farther than he need; but I must be
content.&nbsp; The best is, I lodge just over against Dr.
Atterbury&rsquo;s house, and yet perhaps I shall not like the
place the better for that.&nbsp; Well, I will stay till to-morrow
before I answer your letter; and you must suppose me always
writing at Chelsea from henceforward, till I alter, and say
London.&nbsp; This letter goes on Saturday, which will be just a
fortnight; so go and cheat Goody Stoyte, etc.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; Do you know that I fear my whole chest of Florence
is turned sour, at least the two first flasks were so, and hardly
drinkable.&nbsp; How plaguy unfortunate am I! and the
Secretary&rsquo;s own is the best I ever tasted; and I must not
tell him, but be as thankful as if it were the best in
Christendom.&nbsp; I went to town in the sixpenny stage to-day;
and hearing Mr. Harley was not at home, I went to see him,
because I knew by the message of his lying porter that he was at
home.&nbsp; He was very well, and just going out, but made me
promise to dine with him; and betwixt that and indeed strolling
about, I lost four pound seven shillings at play&mdash;with
a&mdash;&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;bookseller, and got but about half
a dozen books. <a name="citation201a"></a><a href="#footnote201a"
class="citation">[201a]</a>&nbsp; I will buy no more books now,
that&rsquo;s certain.&nbsp; Well, I dined at Mr. Harley&rsquo;s,
came away at six, shifted my gown, cassock, and periwig, and
walked hither to Chelsea, as I always design to do when it is
fair.&nbsp; I am heartily sorry to find my friend the Secretary
stand a little ticklish with the rest of the Ministry; there have
been one or two disobliging things that have happened, too long
to tell: and t&rsquo;other day in Parliament, upon a debate of
about thirty-five millions that have not been duly accounted for,
Mr. Secretary, in his warmth of speech, and zeal for his friend
Mr. Brydges, <a name="citation201b"></a><a href="#footnote201b"
class="citation">[201b]</a> on whom part of the blame was
falling, said he did not know that either Mr. Brydges or the late
Ministry were at all to blame in this matter; which was very
desperately spoken, and giving up the whole cause: for the chief
quarrel against <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>the late Ministry was the ill management of the
treasure, and was more than all the rest together.&nbsp; I had
heard of this matter: but Mr. Foley <a name="citation202a"></a><a
href="#footnote202a" class="citation">[202a]</a> beginning to
discourse to-day at table, without naming Mr. St. John, I turned
to Mr. Harley, and said if the late Ministry were not to blame in
that article, he (Mr. Harley) ought to lose his head for putting
the Queen upon changing them.&nbsp; He made it a jest; but by
some words dropped, I easily saw that they take things ill of Mr.
St. John; and by some hints given me from another hand that I
deal with, I am afraid the Secretary will not stand long.&nbsp;
This is the fate of Courts.&nbsp; I will, if I meet Mr. St. John
alone on Sunday, tell him my opinion, and beg him to set himself
right, else the consequences may be very bad; for I see not how
they can well want him neither, and he would make a troublesome
enemy.&nbsp; But enough of politics.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I forgot to tell you that Mr. Harley
asked me yesterday how he came to disoblige the Archbishop of
Dublin.&nbsp; Upon which (having not his letter about me) I told
him what the Bishop had written to me on that subject, <a
name="citation202b"></a><a href="#footnote202b"
class="citation">[202b]</a> and desired I might read him the
letter some other time.&nbsp; But after all, from what I have
heard from other hands, I am afraid the Archbishop is a little
guilty.&nbsp; Here is one Brent Spencer, a brother of Mr.
Proby&rsquo;s, <a name="citation202c"></a><a href="#footnote202c"
class="citation">[202c]</a> who affirms it, and says he has leave
to do so from Charles Dering, <a name="citation202d"></a><a
href="#footnote202d" class="citation">[202d]</a> who heard the
words; and that Ingoldsby, <a name="citation202e"></a><a
href="#footnote202e" class="citation">[202e]</a> abused the
Archbishop, etc.&nbsp; Well, but now for your saucy letter: I
have no room to answer it; O yes, enough on t&rsquo;other
side.&nbsp; Are you no sicker?&nbsp; Stella jeers Presto for not
coming over by Christmas; but indeed Stella does not jeer, but
reproach, poor poor Presto.&nbsp; And how can I come away and the
First-Fruits not finished?&nbsp; I am of opinion the Duke of
Ormond will do <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>nothing in them before he goes, which will be in a
fortnight, they say; and then they must fall to me to be done in
his absence.&nbsp; No, indeed, I have nothing to print: you know
they have printed the <i>Miscellanies</i> <a
name="citation203a"></a><a href="#footnote203a"
class="citation">[203a]</a> already.&nbsp; Are they on your side
yet?&nbsp; If you have my snuff box, I will have your strong
box.&nbsp; Hi, does Stella take snuff again? or is it only
because it is a fine box?&nbsp; Not the <i>Meddle</i>, but the
<i>Medley</i>, <a name="citation203b"></a><a href="#footnote203b"
class="citation">[203b]</a> you fool.&nbsp; Yes, yes, a wretched
thing, because it is against you Tories: now I think it very
fine, and the <i>Examiner</i> a wretched thing.&mdash;Twist your
mouth, sirrah.&nbsp; Guiscard, and what you will read in the
<i>Narrative</i>, <a name="citation203c"></a><a
href="#footnote203c" class="citation">[203c]</a> I ordered to be
written, and nothing else.&nbsp; The <i>Spectator</i> is written
by Steele, with Addison&rsquo;s help: it is often very
pretty.&nbsp; Yesterday it was made of a noble hint I gave him
long ago for his <i>Tatlers</i>, about an Indian supposed to
write his Travels into England. <a name="citation203d"></a><a
href="#footnote203d" class="citation">[203d]</a>&nbsp; I repent
he ever had it.&nbsp; I intended to have written a book on that
subject.&nbsp; I believe he has spent it all in one paper, and
all the under-hints there are mine too; but I never see him or
Addison.&nbsp; The Queen is well, but I fear will be no long
liver; for I am told she has sometimes the gout in her bowels (I
hate the word <i>bowels</i>).&nbsp; My ears have been, these
three months past, much better than any time these two years; but
now they begin to be a little out of order again.&nbsp; My head
is better, though not right; but I trust to air and
walking.&nbsp; You have got my letter, but what number?&nbsp; I
suppose 18.&nbsp; Well, my shin has been well this month.&nbsp;
No, Mrs. Westley <a name="citation203e"></a><a
href="#footnote203e" class="citation">[203e]</a> came away
without her husband&rsquo;s knowledge, while she was in the
country: she has written to me for some tea.&nbsp; They lie; Mr.
Harley&rsquo;s wound was very terrible: he had convulsions, and
very narrowly escaped.&nbsp; The bruise was nine times worse than
the wound: he is weak still.&nbsp; Well, Brooks married; I know
all that.&nbsp; I am sorry <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>for Mrs. Walls&rsquo;s eye: I hope
&rsquo;tis better.&nbsp; O yes, you are great walkers: but I have
heard them say, &ldquo;Much talkers, little walkers&rdquo;: and I
believe I may apply the old proverb to you&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>If you talked no more than you walked,<br />
Those that think you wits would be baulked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, Stella shall have a large printed Bible: I have put it
down among my commissions for MD.&nbsp; I am glad to hear you
have taken the fancy of intending to read the Bible.&nbsp; Pox
take the box; is not it come yet?&nbsp; This is trusting to your
young fellows, young women; &rsquo;tis your fault: I thought you
had such power with Sterne that he would fly over Mount Atlas to
serve you.&nbsp; You say you are not splenetic; but if you be,
faith, you will break poor Presto&rsquo;s&mdash;I will not say
the rest; but I vow to God, if I could decently come over now, I
would, and leave all schemes of politics and ambition for
ever.&nbsp; I have not the opportunities here of preserving my
health by riding, etc., that I have in Ireland; and the want of
health is a great cooler of making one&rsquo;s court.&nbsp; You
guess right about my being bit with a direction from Walls, and
the letter from MD: I believe I described it in one of my
last.&nbsp; This goes to-night; and I must now rise and walk to
town, and walk back in the evening.&nbsp; God Almighty bless and
preserve poor MD.&nbsp; Farewell.</p>
<p>O, faith, don&rsquo;t think, saucy noses, that I&rsquo;ll fill
this third side: I can&rsquo;t stay a letter above a fortnight:
it must go then; and you would rather see a short one like this,
than want it a week longer.</p>
<p>My humble service to the Dean, and Mrs. Walls, and good, kind,
hearty Mrs. Stoyte, and honest Catherine.</p>

205</span>LETTER XXII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Chelsea</span>,
<i>April</i> 28, 1711.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> night.&nbsp; I say at night,
because I finished my twenty-first this morning here, and put it
into the post-office my own self, like a good boy.&nbsp; I think
I am a little before you now, young women: I am writing my
twenty-second, and have received your thirteenth.&nbsp; I got to
town between twelve and one, and put on my new gown and periwig,
and dined with Lord Abercorn, where I had not been since the
marriage of his son Lord Peasley, <a name="citation205a"></a><a
href="#footnote205a" class="citation">[205a]</a> who has got ten
thousand pounds with a wife.&nbsp; I am now a country
gentleman.&nbsp; I walked home as I went, and am a little weary,
and am got into bed: I hope in God the air and exercise will do
me a little good.&nbsp; I have been inquiring about statues for
Mrs. Ashe: I made Lady Abercorn <a name="citation205b"></a><a
href="#footnote205b" class="citation">[205b]</a> go with me; and
will send them word next post to Clogher.&nbsp; I hate to buy for
her: I am sure she will maunder.&nbsp; I am going to study.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; I had a charming walk to and from town to-day: I
washed, shaved and all, and changed gown and periwig, by half an
hour after nine, and went to the Secretary, who told me how he
had differed with his friends in Parliament: I apprehended this
division, and told him a great deal of it.&nbsp; I went to Court,
and there several mentioned it to me as what they much
disliked.&nbsp; I dined with the Secretary; and we proposed doing
some business of importance in the afternoon, which he broke to
me first, and said how he and Mr. Harley were convinced of the
necessity of it; yet he suffered one of his under-secretaries to
come upon us after dinner, who stayed till six, and so nothing
was done: and what care I? he shall send to me the next time, and
ask twice.&nbsp; To-morrow I go to the election at Westminster
School, where lads are chosen for the University: they say it is
a sight, and a great trial of wits.&nbsp; Our Expedition Fleet is
but just sailed: I believe it will come to nothing.&nbsp; Mr. <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>Secretary
frets at their tediousness, but hopes great things from it,
though he owns four or five princes are in the secret; and, for
that reason, I fear it is no secret to France.&nbsp; There are
eight regiments; and the Admiral <a name="citation206a"></a><a
href="#footnote206a" class="citation">[206a]</a> is your
Walker&rsquo;s brother the midwife.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; Morn.&nbsp; I am here in a pretty pickle: it rains
hard; and the cunning natives of Chelsea have outwitted me, and
taken up all the three stage coaches.&nbsp; What shall I
do?&nbsp; I must go to town: this is your fault.&nbsp; I cannot
walk: I will borrow a coat.&nbsp; This is the blind side of my
lodging out of town; I must expect such inconveniences as
these.&nbsp; Faith, I&rsquo;ll walk in the rain.&nbsp;
Morrow.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I got a gentleman&rsquo;s chaise by
chance, and so went to town for a shilling, and lie this night in
town.&nbsp; I was at the election of lads at Westminster to-day,
and a very silly thing it is; but they say there will be fine
doings to-morrow.&nbsp; I dined with Dr. Freind, <a
name="citation206b"></a><a href="#footnote206b"
class="citation">[206b]</a> the second master of the school, with
a dozen parsons and others: Prior would make me stay.&nbsp; Mr.
Harley is to hear the election to-morrow; and we are all to dine
with tickets, and hear fine speeches.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis terrible
rainy weather again: I lie at a friend&rsquo;s in the City.</p>
<p>May 1.&nbsp; I wish you a merry May Day, and a thousand
more.&nbsp; I was baulked at Westminster; I came too late: I
heard no speeches nor verses.&nbsp; They would not let me in to
their dining-place for want of a ticket; and I would not send in
for one, because Mr. Harley excused his coming, and Atterbury was
not there; and I cared not for the rest: and so my friend Lewis
and I dined with Kitt Musgrave, <a name="citation206c"></a><a
href="#footnote206c" class="citation">[206c]</a> if you know such
a man: and, the weather mending, I walked gravely home <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>this
evening; and so I design to walk and walk till I am well: I fancy
myself a little better already.&nbsp; How does poor Stella?&nbsp;
Dingley is well enough.&nbsp; Go, get you gone, naughty girl, you
are well enough.&nbsp; O dear MD, contrive to have some share of
the country this spring: go to Finglas, or Donnybrook, or
Clogher, or Killala, or Lowth.&nbsp; Have you got your box
yet?&nbsp; Yes, yes.&nbsp; Do not write to me again till this
letter goes: I must make haste, that I may write two for
one.&nbsp; Go to the Bath: I hope you are now at the Bath, if you
had a mind to go; or go to Wexford: do something for your
living.&nbsp; Have you given up my lodging, according to
order?&nbsp; I have had just now a compliment from Dean
Atterbury&rsquo;s lady, <a name="citation207a"></a><a
href="#footnote207a" class="citation">[207a]</a> to command the
garden and library, and whatever the house affords.&nbsp; I lodge
just over against them; but the Dean is in town with his
Convocation: so I have my Dean and Prolocutor as well as you,
young women, though he has not so good wine, nor so much
meat.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A fine day, but begins to grow a little warm; and
that makes your little fat Presto sweat in the forehead.&nbsp;
Pray, are not the fine buns sold here in our town; was it not
<i>Rrrrrrrrrare Chelsea buns</i>? <a name="citation207b"></a><a
href="#footnote207b" class="citation">[207b]</a>&nbsp; I bought
one to-day in my walk; it cost me a penny; it was stale, and I
did not like it, as the man said, etc.&nbsp; Sir Andrew Fountaine
and I dined at Mrs. Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s, and had a flask of my
Florence, which lies in their cellar; and so I came home gravely,
and saw nobody of consequence to-day.&nbsp; I am very easy here,
nobody plaguing me in a morning; and Patrick saves many a score
lies.&nbsp; I sent over to Mrs. Atterbury to know whether I might
wait on her; but she is gone a visiting: we have exchanged some
compliments, but I have not seen her yet.&nbsp; We have no news
in our town.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I did not go to town to-day, it was so terrible
rainy; <a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>nor have I stirred out of my room till eight this
evening, when I crossed the way to see Mrs. Atterbury, and thank
her for her civilities.&nbsp; She would needs send me some veal,
and small beer, and ale, to-day at dinner; and I have lived a
scurvy, dull, splenetic day, for want of MD: I often thought how
happy I could have been, had it rained eight thousand times more,
if MD had been with a body.&nbsp; My Lord Rochester <a
name="citation208a"></a><a href="#footnote208a"
class="citation">[208a]</a> is dead this morning; they say at one
o&rsquo;clock; and I hear he died suddenly.&nbsp; To-morrow I
shall know more.&nbsp; He is a great loss to us: I cannot think
who will succeed him as Lord President.&nbsp; I have been writing
a long letter to Lord Peterborow, and am dull.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Lord Shelburne&rsquo;s, where Lady
Kerry <a name="citation208b"></a><a href="#footnote208b"
class="citation">[208b]</a> made me a present of four India
handkerchiefs, which I have a mind to keep for little MD, only
that I had rather, etc.&nbsp; I have been a mighty
handkerchief-monger, and have bought abundance of snuff ones
since I have left off taking snuff.&nbsp; And I am resolved, when
I come over, MD shall be acquainted with Lady Kerry: we have
struck up a mighty friendship; and she has much better sense than
any other lady of your country.&nbsp; We are almost in love with
one another: but she is most egregiously ugly; but perfectly
well-bred, and governable as I please.&nbsp; I am resolved, when
I come, to keep no company but MD: you know I kept my resolution
last time; and, except Mr. Addison, conversed with none but you
and your club of deans and Stoytes.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis three weeks,
young women, since I had a letter from you; and yet, methinks, I
would not have another for five pounds till this is gone; and yet
I send every day to the Coffee-house, and I would fain have a
letter, and not have a letter: and I do not know what, nor I do
not know how, and this goes on very slow; it is a week to-morrow
since I began it.&nbsp; I am a poor country <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>gentleman,
and do not know how the world passes.&nbsp; Do you know that
every syllable I write I hold my lips just for all the world as
if I were talking in our own little language to MD?&nbsp; Faith,
I am very silly; but I cannot help it for my life.&nbsp; I got
home early to-night.&nbsp; My solicitors, that used to ply me
every morning, knew not where to find me; and I am so happy not
to hear &ldquo;Patrick, Patrick,&rdquo; called a hundred times
every morning.&nbsp; But I looked backward, and find I have said
this before.&nbsp; What care I?&nbsp; Go to the Dean, and roast
the oranges.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I dined to-day with my friend Lewis, and we were deep
in politics how to save the present Ministry; for I am afraid of
Mr. Secretary, as I believe I told you.&nbsp; I went in the
evening to see Mr. Harley; and, upon my word, I was in perfect
joy.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary was just going out of the door; but I
made him come back, and there was the old Saturday Club, Lord
Keeper, Lord Rivers, Mr. Secretary, Mr. Harley, and I; the first
time since his stabbing.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary went away; but I
stayed till nine, and made Mr. Harley show me his breast, and
tell all the story; and I showed him the Archbishop of
Dublin&rsquo;s letter, and defended him effectually.&nbsp; We
were all in mighty good humour.&nbsp; Lord Keeper and I left them
together, and I walked here after nine two miles, and I found a
parson drunk fighting with a seaman, and Patrick and I were so
wise to part them, but the seaman followed him to Chelsea,
cursing at him, and the parson slipped into a house, and I know
no more.&nbsp; It mortified me to see a man in my coat so
overtaken.&nbsp; A pretty scene for one that just came from
sitting with the Prime Ministers!&nbsp; I had no money in my
pocket, and so could not be robbed.&nbsp; However, nothing but
Mr. Harley shall make me take such a journey again.&nbsp; We
don&rsquo;t yet know who will be President in Lord
Rochester&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; I measured, and found that the
penknife would have killed Mr. Harley if it had gone but half the
breadth of my thumb-nail lower, so near was he to death.&nbsp; I
was so curious as to ask him what were his thoughts while they <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>were
carrying him home in the chair.&nbsp; He said he concluded
himself a dead man.&nbsp; He will not allow that Guiscard gave
him the second stab; though my Lord Keeper, who is blind, and I
that was not there, are positive in it.&nbsp; He wears a plaster
still as broad as half a crown.&nbsp; Smoke how wide the lines
are, but, faith, I don&rsquo;t do it on purpose: but I have
changed my side in this new Chelsea bed, and I do not know how,
methinks, but it is so unfit, and so awkward, never saw the
like.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; You must remember to enclose your letters in a fair
paper, and direct the outside thus: &ldquo;To Erasmus Lewis,
Esq.; at my Lord Dartmouth&rsquo;s office at
Whitehall.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said so before, but it may miscarry,
you know, yet I think none of my letters did ever miscarry;
faith, I think never one; among all the privateers and the
storms.&nbsp; O, faith, my letters are too good to be lost.&nbsp;
MD&rsquo;s letters may tarry, but never miscarry, as the old
woman used to say.&nbsp; And indeed, how should they miscarry,
when they never come before their time?&nbsp; It was a terrible
rainy day; yet I made a shift to steal fair weather overhead
enough to go and come in.&nbsp; I was early with the Secretary,
and dined with him afterwards.&nbsp; In the morning I began to
chide him, and tell him my fears of his proceedings.&nbsp; But
Arthur Moore <a name="citation210a"></a><a href="#footnote210a"
class="citation">[210a]</a> came up and relieved him.&nbsp; But I
forgot, for you never heard of Arthur Moore.&nbsp; But when I get
Mr. Harley alone, I will know the bottom.&nbsp; You will have Dr.
Raymond over before this letter, and what care you?</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; I hope and believe my walks every day do me
good.&nbsp; I was busy at home, and set out late this morning,
and dined with Mrs. Vanhomrigh, at whose lodgings I always change
my gown and periwig.&nbsp; I visited this afternoon, and among
others, poor Biddy Floyd, <a name="citation210b"></a><a
href="#footnote210b" class="citation">[210b]</a> who is very red,
but I believe won&rsquo;t be much marked.&nbsp; As I was coming
home, I met Sir George Beaumont <a name="citation210c"></a><a
href="#footnote210c" class="citation">[210c]</a> in the Pall
Mall, who would needs walk with me as far as Buckingham
House.&nbsp; I was telling him of my head; he said he had been
ill of the <a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>same disorder, and by all means forbid me bohea tea,
which, he said, always gave it him; and that Dr. Radcliffe said
it was very bad.&nbsp; Now I had observed the same thing, and
have left it off this month, having found myself ill after it
several times; and I mention it that Stella may consider it for
her own poor little head: a pound lies ready packed up and
directed for Mrs. Walls, to be sent by the first
convenience.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary told me yesterday that Mr.
Harley would this week be Lord Treasurer and a peer; so I expect
it every day; yet perhaps it may not be till Parliament is up,
which will be in a fortnight.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; I was to-day with the Duke of Ormond, and recommended
to him the care of poor Joe Beaumont, who promises me to do him
all justice and favour, and give him encouragement; and desired I
would give a memorial to Ned Southwell about it, which I will,
and so tell Joe when you see him, though he knows it already by a
letter I writ to Mr. Warburton. <a name="citation211a"></a><a
href="#footnote211a" class="citation">[211a]</a>&nbsp; It was
bloody hot walking to-day.&nbsp; I dined in the City, and went
and came by water; and it rained so this evening again, that I
thought I should hardly be able to get a dry hour to walk home
in.&nbsp; I will send to-morrow to the Coffee-house for a letter
from MD; but I would not have one methinks till this is gone, as
it shall on Saturday.&nbsp; I visited the Duchess of Ormond this
morning; she does not go over with the Duke.&nbsp; I spoke to her
to get a lad touched for the evil, <a name="citation211b"></a><a
href="#footnote211b" class="citation">[211b]</a> the son of a
grocer in Capel Street, one Bell; the ladies have bought sugar
and plums of him.&nbsp; Mrs. Mary used to go there often.&nbsp;
This is Patrick&rsquo;s account; and the poor fellow has been
here some months with his boy.&nbsp; But the Queen has not been
able to touch, and it now grows so warm, I fear she will not at
all.&nbsp; Go, go, go to the Dean&rsquo;s, and let him carry you
to Donnybrook, and cut asparagus.&nbsp; Has Parvisol sent you any
this year?&nbsp; I cannot sleep in the beginnings <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>of the
nights, the heat or something hinders me, and I am drowsy in the
mornings.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Dr. Freind came this morning to visit
Atterbury&rsquo;s lady and children as physician, and persuaded
me to go with him to town in his chariot.&nbsp; He told me he had
been an hour before with Sir Cholmley Dering, Charles
Dering&rsquo;s nephew, and head of that family in Kent, for which
he is Knight of the shire.&nbsp; He said he left him dying of a
pistol-shot quite through the body, by one Mr. Thornhill. <a
name="citation212a"></a><a href="#footnote212a"
class="citation">[212a]</a>&nbsp; They fought at sword and pistol
this morning in Tuttle Fields, <a name="citation212b"></a><a
href="#footnote212b" class="citation">[212b]</a> their pistols so
near that the muzzles touched.&nbsp; Thornhill discharged first;
and Dering, having received the shot, discharged his pistol as he
was falling, so it went into the air.&nbsp; The story of this
quarrel is long.&nbsp; Thornhill had lost seven teeth by a kick
in the mouth from Dering, who had first knocked him down; this
was above a fortnight ago.&nbsp; Dering was next week to be
married to a fine young lady.&nbsp; This makes a noise here, but
you will not value it.&nbsp; Well, Mr. Harley, Lord Keeper, and
one or two more, are to be made lords immediately; their patents
are now passing, and I read the preamble to Mr. Harley&rsquo;s,
full of his praises.&nbsp; Lewis and I dined with Ford: I found
the wine; two flasks of my Florence, and two bottles of six that
Dr. Raymond sent me of French wine; he sent it to me to drink
with Sir Robert Raymond and Mr. Harley&rsquo;s brother, <a
name="citation212c"></a><a href="#footnote212c"
class="citation">[212c]</a> whom I had introduced him to; but
they never could find time to come; and now I have left the town,
and it is too late.&nbsp; Raymond will think it a cheat.&nbsp;
What care I, sirrah?</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Pshaw, pshaw.&nbsp; Patrick brought me four letters
to-day: <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>from Dilly at Bath; Joe; Parvisol; and what was the
fourth, who can tell?&nbsp; Stand away, who&rsquo;ll guess?&nbsp;
Who can it be?&nbsp; You old man with a stick, can you tell who
the fourth is from?&nbsp; Iss, an please your honour, it is from
one Madam MD, Number Fourteen.&nbsp; Well; but I can&rsquo;t send
this away now, because it was here, and I was in town; but it
shall go on Saturday, and this is Thursday night, and it will be
time enough for Wexford.&nbsp; Take my method: I write here to
Parvisol to lend Stella twenty pounds, and to take her note
promissory to pay it in half a year, etc.&nbsp; You shall see,
and if you want more, let me know afterwards; and be sure my
money shall be always paid constantly too.&nbsp; Have you been
good or ill housewives, pray?</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Joe has written me to get him a collector&rsquo;s
place, nothing less; he says all the world knows of my great
intimacy with Mr. Harley, and that the smallest word to him will
do.&nbsp; This is the constant cant of puppies who are at a
distance, and strangers to Courts and Ministers.&nbsp; My answer
is this, which pray send: that I am ready to serve Joe as far as
I can; that I have spoken to the Duke of Ormond about his money,
as I writ to Warburton; that for the particular he mentions, it
is a work of time, which I cannot think of at present; but, if
accidents and opportunities should happen hereafter, I would not
be wanting; that I know best how far my credit goes; that he is
at a distance, and cannot judge; that I would be glad to do him
good, and if fortune throws an opportunity in my way I shall not
be wanting.&nbsp; This is my answer, which you may send or read
to him.&nbsp; Pray contrive that Parvisol may not run away with
my two hundred pounds; but get Burton&rsquo;s <a
name="citation213"></a><a href="#footnote213"
class="citation">[213]</a> note, and let the money be returned me
by bill.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t laugh, for I will be suspicious.&nbsp;
Teach Parvisol to enclose, and direct the outside to Mr.
Lewis.&nbsp; I will answer your letter in my next, only what I
take notice of here excepted.&nbsp; <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>I forgot to tell you that at the
Court of Requests to-day I could not find a dinner I liked, and
it grew late, and I dined with Mrs. Vanhomrigh, etc.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I will finish this letter before I go
to town, because I shall be busy, and have neither time nor place
there.&nbsp; Farewell, etc. etc.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Chelsea</span>,
<i>May</i> 12, 1711.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">sent</span> you my twenty-second this
afternoon in town.&nbsp; I dined with Mr. Harley and the old
Club, Lord Rivers, Lord Keeper, and Mr. Secretary.&nbsp; They
rallied me last week, and said I must have Mr. St. John&rsquo;s
leave; so I writ to him yesterday, that foreseeing I should never
dine again with Sir Simon Harcourt, Knight, and Robert Harley,
Esq., I was resolved to do it to-day.&nbsp; The jest is, that
before Saturday <a name="citation214"></a><a href="#footnote214"
class="citation">[214]</a> next we expect they will be lords; for
Mr. Harley&rsquo;s patent is drawing, to be Earl of Oxford.&nbsp;
Mr. Secretary and I came away at seven, and he brought me to our
town&rsquo;s end in his coach; so I lost my walk.&nbsp; St. John
read my letter to the company, which was all raillery, and passed
purely.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; It rained all last night and this morning as heavy
as lead; but I just got fair weather to walk to town before
church.&nbsp; The roads are all over in deep puddle.&nbsp; The
hay of our town is almost fit to be mowed.&nbsp; I went to Court
after church (as I always do on Sundays), and then dined with Mr.
Secretary, who has engaged me for every Sunday; and poor MD dined
at home upon a bit of veal and a pint of wine.&nbsp; Is it not
plaguy insipid to tell you every day where I dine? yet now I have
got into the way of it, I cannot forbear it neither.&nbsp;
Indeed, Mr. Presto, you had better go answer MD&rsquo;s letter,
N. 14.&nbsp; I will answer it when I please, Mr. Doctor.&nbsp; <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>What is
that you say?&nbsp; The Court was very full this morning,
expecting Mr. Harley would be declared Earl of Oxford and have
the Treasurer&rsquo;s staff.&nbsp; Mr. Harley never comes to
Court at all; somebody there asked me the reason.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the Lord of Oxford
knows.&rdquo;&nbsp; He always goes to the Queen by the back
stairs.&nbsp; I was told for certain, you jackanapes, Lord Santry
<a name="citation215a"></a><a href="#footnote215a"
class="citation">[215a]</a> was dead, Captain Cammock <a
name="citation215b"></a><a href="#footnote215b"
class="citation">[215b]</a> assured me so; and now he&rsquo;s
alive again, they say; but that shan&rsquo;t do: he shall be dead
to me as long as he lives.&nbsp; Dick Tighe <a
name="citation215c"></a><a href="#footnote215c"
class="citation">[215c]</a> and I meet, and never stir our
hats.&nbsp; I am resolved to mistake him for Witherington, the
little nasty lawyer that came up to me so sternly at the Castle
the day I left Ireland.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll ask the gentleman I saw
walking with him how long Witherington has been in town.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; I went to town to-day by water.&nbsp; The hail quite
discouraged me from walking, and there is no shade in the
greatest part of the way.&nbsp; I took the first boat, and had a
footman my companion; then I went again by water, and dined in
the City with a printer, to whom I carried a pamphlet in
manuscript, that Mr. Secretary gave me.&nbsp; The printer sent it
to the Secretary for his approbation, and he desired me to look
it over, which I did, and found it a very scurvy piece.&nbsp; The
reason I tell you so, is because it was done by your parson Slap,
Scrap, Flap (what d&rsquo;ye call him), Trapp, <a
name="citation215d"></a><a href="#footnote215d"
class="citation">[215d]</a> your Chancellor&rsquo;s
chaplain.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis called <i>A Character of the Present
Set of Whigs</i>, and is going to be printed, and no <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>doubt the
author will take care to produce it in Ireland.&nbsp; Dr. Freind
was with me, and pulled out a twopenny pamphlet just published,
called <i>The State of Wit</i>, <a name="citation216a"></a><a
href="#footnote216a" class="citation">[216a]</a> giving a
character of all the papers that have come out of late.&nbsp; The
author seems to be a Whig, yet he speaks very highly of a paper
called the <i>Examiner</i>, and says the supposed author of it is
Dr. Swift.&nbsp; But above all things he praises the
<i>Tatlers</i> and <i>Spectators</i>; and I believe Steele and
Addison were privy to the printing of it.&nbsp; Thus is one
treated by these impudent dogs.&nbsp; And that villain Curll <a
name="citation216b"></a><a href="#footnote216b"
class="citation">[216b]</a> has scraped up some trash, and calls
it Dr. Swift&rsquo;s <i>Miscellanies</i>, with the name at large:
and I can get no satisfaction of him.&nbsp; Nay, Mr. Harley told
me he had read it, and only laughed at me before Lord Keeper and
the rest.&nbsp; Since I came home, I have been sitting with the
Prolocutor, Dean Atterbury, who is my neighbour over the way, but
generally keeps in town with his Convocation.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
late, etc.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; My walk to town to-day was after ten, and
prodigiously hot.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Shelburne, and have
desired Mrs. Pratt, who lodges there, to carry over Mrs.
Walls&rsquo;s tea; I hope she will do it, and they talk of going
in a fortnight.&nbsp; My way is this: I leave my best gown and
periwig at Mrs. Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s, then walk up the Pall Mall,
through the Park, out at Buckingham House, and so to Chelsea a
little beyond the church: I set out about sunset, and get here in
something less than an hour; it is two good miles, and just five
thousand seven hundred and forty-eight steps; so there is four
miles a day walking, without reckoning what I walk while I stay
in town.&nbsp; When I pass the Mall in the evening, it is
prodigious to see the number of ladies walking there; and I
always cry shame at the ladies of Ireland, who never walk at all,
as if their legs were of no use, but to be laid aside.&nbsp; I
have been now almost three weeks here, and I <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>thank God,
am much better in my head, if it does but continue.&nbsp; I tell
you what, if I was with you, when we went to Stoyte at
Donnybrook, we would only take a coach to the hither end of
Stephen&rsquo;s Green, and from thence go every step on foot,
yes, faith, every step; it would do DD <a
name="citation217a"></a><a href="#footnote217a"
class="citation">[217a]</a> good as well as Presto. <a
name="citation217b"></a><a href="#footnote217b"
class="citation">[217b]</a>&nbsp; Everybody tells me I look
better already; for, faith, I looked sadly, that is
certain.&nbsp; My breakfast is milk porridge: I do not love it;
faith, I hate it, but it is cheap and wholesome; and I hate to be
obliged to either of those qualities for anything. <a
name="citation217c"></a><a href="#footnote217c"
class="citation">[217c]</a></p>
<p>16.&nbsp; I wonder why Presto will be so tedious in answering
MD&rsquo;s letters; because he would keep the best to the last, I
suppose.&nbsp; Well, Presto must be humoured, it must be as he
will have it, or there will be an old to do. <a
name="citation217d"></a><a href="#footnote217d"
class="citation">[217d]</a>&nbsp; Dead with heat; are not you
very hot?&nbsp; My walks make my forehead sweat rarely; sometimes
my morning journey is by water, as it was to-day with one Parson
Richardson, <a name="citation217e"></a><a href="#footnote217e"
class="citation">[217e]</a> who came to see me, on his going to
Ireland; and with him I send Mrs. Walls&rsquo;s tea, and three
books <a name="citation217f"></a><a href="#footnote217f"
class="citation">[217f]</a> I got from the Lords of the Treasury
for the College.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Shelburne to-day; Lady
Kerry and Mrs. Pratt are going likewise for Ireland.&mdash;Lord!
I forgot, I dined with Mr. Prior to-day, at his house, with Dean
Atterbury and others; and came home pretty late, and I think
I&rsquo;m in a fuzz, and don&rsquo;t know what I say, never saw
the like.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; Sterne came here by water to see me this morning,
and I went back with him to his boat.&nbsp; He tells me that Mrs.
Edgworth <a name="citation217g"></a><a href="#footnote217g"
class="citation">[217g]</a> married a fellow in her journey to
Chester; so I believe she little thought of anybody&rsquo;s box
but her own.&nbsp; I desired Sterne to give me directions where
to get the box in Chester, which he says he will to-morrow; and I
will write <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>to Richardson to get it up there as he goes by, and
whip it over.&nbsp; It is directed to Mrs. Curry: you must
caution her of it, and desire her to send it you when it
comes.&nbsp; Sterne says Jemmy Leigh loves London mightily; that
makes him stay so long, I believe, and not Sterne&rsquo;s
business, which Mr. Harley&rsquo;s accident has put much
backward.&nbsp; We expect now every day that he will be Earl of
Oxford and Lord Treasurer.&nbsp; His patent is passing; but, they
say, Lord Keeper&rsquo;s not yet; at least his son, young
Harcourt, told me so t&rsquo;other day.&nbsp; I dined to-day
privately with my friend Lewis at his lodgings at
Whitehall.&nbsp; T&rsquo;other day at Whitehall I met a lady of
my acquaintance, whom I had not seen before since I came to
England; we were mighty glad to see each other, and she has
engaged me to visit her, as I design to do.&nbsp; It is one Mrs.
Colledge: she has lodgings at Whitehall, having been seamstress
to King William, worth three hundred a year.&nbsp; Her father was
a fanatic joiner, <a name="citation218a"></a><a
href="#footnote218a" class="citation">[218a]</a> hanged for
treason in Shaftesbury&rsquo;s plot.&nbsp; This noble person and
I were brought acquainted, some years ago, by Lady Berkeley. <a
name="citation218b"></a><a href="#footnote218b"
class="citation">[218b]</a>&nbsp; I love good creditable
acquaintance: I love to be the worst of the company: I am not of
those that say, &ldquo;For want of company, welcome
trumpery.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was this evening with Lady Kerry and
Mrs. Pratt at Vauxhall, to hear the nightingales; but they are
almost past singing.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; I was hunting the Secretary to-day in vain about
some business, and dined with Colonel Crowe, late Governor of
Barbados, <a name="citation218c"></a><a href="#footnote218c"
class="citation">[218c]</a> and your friend Sterne was the third:
he is very kind to Sterne, and helps him in his business, which
lies asleep till Mr. Harley is Lord Treasurer, because nothing of
moment is now done in the Treasury, the change being <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>expected
every day.&nbsp; I sat with Dean Atterbury till one o&rsquo;clock
after I came home; so &rsquo;tis late, etc.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; Do you know that about our town we are mowing
already and making hay, and it smells so sweet as we walk through
the flowery meads; but the hay-making nymphs are perfect drabs,
nothing so clean and pretty as farther in the country.&nbsp;
There is a mighty increase of dirty wenches in straw hats since I
knew London.&nbsp; I stayed at home till five o&rsquo;clock, and
dined with Dean Atterbury; then went by water to Mr.
Harley&rsquo;s, where the Saturday Club was met, with the
addition of the Duke of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; I whispered Lord Rivers
that I did not like to see a stranger among us; and the rogue
told it aloud: but Mr. Secretary said the Duke writ to have
leave; so I appeared satisfied, and so we laughed.&nbsp; Mr.
Secretary told me the Duke of Buckingham <a
name="citation219"></a><a href="#footnote219"
class="citation">[219]</a> had been talking to him much about me,
and desired my acquaintance.&nbsp; I answered it could not be,
for he had not made sufficient advances.&nbsp; Then the Duke of
Shrewsbury said he thought that Duke was not used to make
advances.&nbsp; I said I could not help that; for I always
expected advances in proportion to men&rsquo;s quality, and more
from a duke than any other man.&nbsp; The Duke replied that he
did not mean anything of his quality; which was handsomely said
enough; for he meant his pride: and I have invented a notion to
believe that nobody is proud.&nbsp; At ten all the company went
away; and from ten to twelve Mr. Harley and I sat together, where
we talked through a great deal of matters I had a mind to settle
with him; and then walked in a fine moonshine night to Chelsea,
where I got by one.&nbsp; Lord Rivers conjured me not to walk so
late; but I would, because I had no other way; but I had no money
to lose.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; By what the Lord Keeper told me last night, I find
he will not be made a peer so soon; but Mr. Harley&rsquo;s patent
for Earl of Oxford is now drawing, and will be done in three
days.&nbsp; We made him own it, which he did scurvily, and <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>then talked
of it like the rest.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary had too much company
with him to-day; so I came away soon after dinner.&nbsp; I give
no man liberty to swear or talk b&mdash;dy, and I found some of
them were in constraint, so I left them to themselves.&nbsp; I
wish you a merry Whitsuntide, and pray tell me how you pass away
your time; but, faith, you are going to Wexford, and I fear this
letter is too late; it shall go on Thursday, and sooner it
cannot, I have so much business to hinder me answering
yours.&nbsp; Where must I direct in your absence?&nbsp; Do you
quit your lodgings?</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; Going to town this morning, I met in the Pall Mall a
clergyman of Ireland, whom I love very well and was glad to see,
and with him a little jackanapes, of Ireland too, who married
Nanny Swift, Uncle Adam&rsquo;s <a name="citation220a"></a><a
href="#footnote220a" class="citation">[220a]</a> daughter, one
Perry; perhaps you may have heard of him.&nbsp; His wife has sent
him here, to get a place from Lowndes; <a
name="citation220b"></a><a href="#footnote220b"
class="citation">[220b]</a> because my uncle and Lowndes married
two sisters, and Lowndes is a great man here in the Treasury; but
by good luck I have no acquaintance with him: however, he
expected I should be his friend to Lowndes, and one word of mine,
etc., the old cant.&nbsp; But I will not go two yards to help
him.&nbsp; I dined with Mrs. Vanhomrigh, where I keep my best
gown and periwig, to put on when I come to town and be a
spark.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; I dined to-day in the City, and coming home this
evening, I met Sir Thomas Mansel and Mr. Lewis in the Park.&nbsp;
Lewis whispered me that Mr. Harley&rsquo;s patent for the Earl of
Oxford was passed in Mr. Secretary St. John&rsquo;s office; so
to-morrow or next day, I suppose, he will be declared Earl of
Oxford, and have the staff. <a name="citation220c"></a><a
href="#footnote220c" class="citation">[220c]</a>&nbsp; This man
has grown by persecutions, turnings out, and stabbing.&nbsp; What
waiting, and crowding, and bowing will be at his levee! yet, if
human nature be capable of so much constancy, I should <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>believe he
will be the same man still, bating the necessary forms of
grandeur he must keep up.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis late, sirrahs, and
I&rsquo;ll go sleep.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I sat up late last night, and waked
late to-day; but will now answer your letter in bed before I go
to town, and I will send it to-morrow; for perhaps you
mayn&rsquo;t go so soon to Wexford.&mdash;No, you are not out in
your number; the last was Number 14, and so I told you twice or
thrice; will you never be satisfied?&nbsp; What shall we do for
poor Stella?&nbsp; Go to Wexford, for God&rsquo;s sake: I wish
you were to walk there by three miles a day, with a good lodging
at every mile&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; Walking has done me so much
good, that I cannot but prescribe it often to poor Stella.&nbsp;
Parvisol has sent me a bill for fifty pounds, which I am sorry
for, having not written to him for it, only mentioned it two
months ago; but I hope he will be able to pay you what I have
drawn upon him for: he never sent me any sum before, but one bill
of twenty pounds half a year ago.&nbsp; You are welcome as my
blood to every farthing I have in the world; and all that grieves
me is, I am not richer, for MD&rsquo;s sake, as hope saved. <a
name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221"
class="citation">[221]</a>&nbsp; I suppose you give up your
lodgings when you go to Wexford; yet that will be inconvenient
too: yet I wish again you were under a necessity of rambling the
country until Michaelmas, faith.&nbsp; No, let them keep the
shelves, with a pox; yet they are exacting people about those
four weeks; or Mrs. Brent may have the shelves, if she
please.&nbsp; I am obliged to your Dean for his kind offer of
lending me money.&nbsp; Will that be enough to say?&nbsp; A
hundred people would lend me money, or to any man who has not the
reputation of a squanderer.&nbsp; O, faith, I should be glad to
be in the same kingdom with MD, however, although you are at
Wexford.&nbsp; But I am kept here by a most capricious fate,
which I would break through, if I could do it with decency or
honour.&mdash;To return without some mark of distinction would
look extremely little; and I would likewise gladly be somewhat
richer than I am.&nbsp; I will say no more, but beg you <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>to be easy
till Fortune take her course, and to believe that MD&rsquo;s
felicity is the great end I aim at in all my pursuits.&nbsp; And
so let us talk no more on this subject, which makes me
melancholy, and that I would fain divert.&nbsp; Believe me, no
man breathing at present has less share of happiness in life than
I: I do not say I am unhappy at all, but that everything here is
tasteless to me for want of being as I would be.&nbsp; And so, a
short sigh, and no more of this.&nbsp; Well, come and let&rsquo;s
see what&rsquo;s next, young women.&nbsp; Pox take Mrs. Edgworth
and Sterne!&nbsp; I will take some methods about that box.&nbsp;
What orders would you have me give about the picture?&nbsp;
Can&rsquo;t you do with it as if it were your own?&nbsp; No, I
hope Manley will keep his place; for I hear nothing of Sir Thomas
Frankland&rsquo;s losing his.&nbsp; Send nothing under cover to
Mr. Addison, but &ldquo;To Erasmus Lewis, Esq.; at my Lord
Dartmouth&rsquo;s office at Whitehall.&rdquo;&nbsp; Direct your
outside so.&mdash;Poor dear Stella, don&rsquo;t write in the
dark, nor in the light neither, but dictate to Dingley; she is a
naughty, healthy girl, and may drudge for both.&nbsp; Are you
good company together? and don&rsquo;t you quarrel too
often?&nbsp; Pray love one another, and kiss one another just
now, as Dingley is reading this; for you quarrelled this morning
just after Mrs. Marget <a name="citation222"></a><a
href="#footnote222" class="citation">[222]</a> had poured water
on Stella&rsquo;s head: I heard the little bird say so.&nbsp;
Well, I have answered everything in your letter that required it,
and yet the second side is not full.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come home
at night, and say more; and to-morrow this goes for
certain.&nbsp; Go, get you gone to your own chambers, and let
Presto rise like a modest gentleman, and walk to town.&nbsp; I
fancy I begin to sweat less in the forehead by constant walking
than I used to do; but then I shall be so sunburnt, the ladies
will not like me.&nbsp; Come, let me rise, sirrahs.&nbsp;
Morrow.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I dined with Ford to-day at his
lodgings, and I found wine out of my own cellar, some of my own
chest of the great Duke&rsquo;s wine: it begins to turn.&nbsp;
They say wine with you in Ireland is half a crown a bottle.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis as Stella says; nothing that once grows dear in
Ireland ever <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>grows cheap again, except corn, with a pox, to ruin the
parson.&nbsp; I had a letter to-day from the Archbishop of
Dublin, giving me further thanks about vindicating him to Mr.
Harley and Mr. St. John, and telling me a long story about your
Mayor&rsquo;s election, <a name="citation223"></a><a
href="#footnote223" class="citation">[223]</a> wherein I find he
has had a finger, and given way to further talk about him; but we
know nothing of it here yet.&nbsp; This walking to and fro, and
dressing myself, takes up so much of my time that I cannot go
among company so much as formerly; yet what must a body do?&nbsp;
I thank God I yet continue much better since I left the town; I
know not how long it may last.&nbsp; I am sure it has done me
some good for the present.&nbsp; I do not totter as I did, but
walk firm as a cock, only once or twice for a minute, I do not
know how; but it went off, and I never followed it.&nbsp; Does
Dingley read my hand as well as ever? do you, sirrah?&nbsp; Poor
Stella must not read Presto&rsquo;s ugly small hand.</p>
<blockquote><p>Preserve your eyes,<br />
If you be wise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your friend Walls&rsquo;s tea will go in a day or two towards
Chester by one Parson Richardson.&nbsp; My humble service to her,
and to good Mrs. Stoyte, and Catherine; and pray walk while you
continue in Dublin.&nbsp; I expect your next but one will be from
Wexford.&nbsp; God bless dearest MD.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary has sent his groom
hither, to invite me to dinner to-day, etc.&nbsp; God Almighty
for ever bless and preserve you both, and give you health,
etc.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; Farewell, etc.</p>
<p>Do not I often say the same thing two or three times in the
same letter, sirrah?</p>
<p>Great wits, they say, have but short memories; that&rsquo;s
good vile conversation.</p>

224</span>LETTER XXIV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Chelsea</span>,
<i>May</i> 24, 1711.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Morning</span>.&nbsp; Once in my life the
number of my letters and of the day of the month is the same;
that&rsquo;s lucky, boys; that&rsquo;s a sign that things will
meet, and that we shall make a figure together.&nbsp; What, will
you still have the impudence to say London, England, because I
say Dublin, Ireland?&nbsp; Is there no difference between London
and Dublin, saucyboxes?&nbsp; I have sealed up my letter, and am
going to town.&nbsp; Morrow, sirrahs.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I
dined with the Secretary to-day; we sat down between five and
six.&nbsp; Mr. Harley&rsquo;s patent passed this morning: he is
now Earl of Oxford, Earl Mortimer, and Lord Harley of Wigmore
Castle.&nbsp; My letter was sealed, or I would have told you this
yesterday; but the public news may tell it you.&nbsp; The Queen,
for all her favour, has kept a rod <a name="citation224"></a><a
href="#footnote224" class="citation">[224]</a> for him in her
closet this week; I suppose he will take it from her, though, in
a day or two.&nbsp; At eight o&rsquo;clock this evening it rained
prodigiously, as it did from five; however, I set out, and in
half-way the rain lessened, and I got home, but tolerably wet;
and this is the first wet walk I have had in a month&rsquo;s time
that I am here but, however, I got to bed, after a short visit to
Atterbury.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; It rained this morning, and I went to town by water;
and Ford and I dined with Mr. Lewis by appointment.&nbsp; I
ordered Patrick to bring my gown and periwig to Mr. Lewis,
because I designed to go to see Lord Oxford, and so I told the
dog; but he never came, though I stayed an hour longer than I
appointed; so I went in my old gown, and sat with him two hours,
but could not talk over some business I had with him; so he has
desired me to dine with him on Sunday, and I must disappoint the
Secretary.&nbsp; My lord set me down at a coffee-house, where I
waited for the Dean of Carlisle&rsquo;s chariot to bring me to
Chelsea; for it has rained prodigiously all this afternoon.&nbsp;
The Dean did not come himself, but sent <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>me his
chariot, which has cost me two shillings to the coachman; and so
I am got home, and Lord knows what is become of Patrick.&nbsp; I
think I must send him over to you; for he is an intolerable
rascal.&nbsp; If I had come without a gown, he would have served
me so, though my life and preferment should have lain upon it:
and I am making a livery for him will cost me four pounds; but I
will order the tailor to-morrow to stop till further
orders.&nbsp; My Lord Oxford can&rsquo;t yet abide to be called
&ldquo;my lord&rdquo;; and when I called him &ldquo;my
lord,&rdquo; he called me &ldquo;Dr. Thomas Swift,&rdquo; <a
name="citation225a"></a><a href="#footnote225a"
class="citation">[225a]</a> which he always does when he has a
mind to tease me.&nbsp; By a second hand, he proposed my being
his chaplain, which I by a second hand excused; but we had no
talk of it to-day: but I will be no man&rsquo;s chaplain
alive.&nbsp; But I must go and be busy.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; I never saw Patrick till this morning, and that only
once, for I dressed myself without him; and when I went to town
he was out of the way.&nbsp; I immediately sent for the tailor,
and ordered him to stop his hand in Patrick&rsquo;s clothes till
further orders.&nbsp; Oh, if it were in Ireland, I should have
turned him off ten times ago; and it is no regard to him, but
myself, that has made me keep him so long.&nbsp; Now I am afraid
to give the rogue his clothes.&nbsp; What shall I do?&nbsp; I
wish MD were here to entreat for him, just here at the
bed&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; Lady Ashburnham <a
name="citation225b"></a><a href="#footnote225b"
class="citation">[225b]</a> has been engaging me this long time
to dine with her, and I set to-day apart for it; and whatever was
the mistake, she sent me word she was at dinner and undressed,
but would be glad to see me in the afternoon: so I dined with
Mrs. Vanhomrigh, and would not go to see her at all, in a
huff.&nbsp; My fine Florence is turning sour with a vengeance,
and I have not drunk half of it.&nbsp; As I was coming home
to-night, Sir Thomas Mansel and Tom Harley <a
name="citation225c"></a><a href="#footnote225c"
class="citation">[225c]</a> met me <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>in the Park, and made me walk with
them till nine, like unreasonable whelps; so I got not here till
ten: but it was a fine evening, and the foot-path clean enough
already after this hard rain.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; Going this morning to town, I saw two old lame
fellows, walking to a brandy-shop, and when they got to the door,
stood a long time complimenting who should go in first.&nbsp;
Though this be no jest to tell, it was an admirable one to
see.&nbsp; I dined to-day with my Lord Oxford and the ladies, the
new Countess, and Lady Betty, <a name="citation226a"></a><a
href="#footnote226a" class="citation">[226a]</a> who has been
these three days a lady born.&nbsp; My lord left us at seven, and
I had no time to speak to him about some affairs; but he promises
in a day or two we shall dine alone; which is mighty likely,
considering we expect every moment that the Queen will give him
the staff, and then he will be so crowded he will be good for
nothing: for aught I know he may have it to-night at Council.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; I had a petition sent me t&rsquo;other day from one
Stephen Gernon, setting forth that he formerly lived with Harry
Tenison, <a name="citation226b"></a><a href="#footnote226b"
class="citation">[226b]</a> who gave him an employment of gauger,
and that he was turned out after Harry&rsquo;s death, and came
for England, and is now starving, or, as he expresses it, <i>that
the staff of life has been of late a stranger to his
appetite</i>.&nbsp; To-day the poor fellow called, and I knew him
very well, a young slender fellow with freckles in his face: you
must remember him; he waited at table as a better sort of
servant.&nbsp; I gave him a crown, and promised to do what I
could to help him to a service, which I did for Harry
Tenison&rsquo;s memory.&nbsp; It was bloody hot walking to-day,
and I was so lazy I dined where my new gown was, at Mrs.
Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s, and came back like a fool, and the Dean of
Carlisle has sat with me till eleven.&nbsp; Lord Oxford has not
the staff yet.</p>
<p><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>29.&nbsp; I was this morning in town by ten, though it
was shaving-day, and went to the Secretary about some affairs,
then visited the Duke and Duchess of Ormond; but the latter was
dressing to go out, and I could not see her.&nbsp; My Lord Oxford
had the staff given him this morning; so now I must call him Lord
Oxford no more, but Lord Treasurer: I hope he will stick there:
this is twice he has changed his name this week; and I heard
to-day in the City (where I dined) that he will very soon have
the Garter.&mdash;Pr&rsquo;ythee, do not you observe how
strangely I have changed my company and manner of living?&nbsp; I
never go to a coffee-house; you hear no more of Addison, Steele,
Henley, Lady Lucy, Mrs. Finch, <a name="citation227a"></a><a
href="#footnote227a" class="citation">[227a]</a> Lord Somers,
Lord Halifax, etc.&nbsp; I think I have altered for the
better.&nbsp; Did I tell you the Archbishop of Dublin has writ me
a long letter of a squabble in your town about choosing a Mayor,
and that he apprehended some censure for the share he had in it?
<a name="citation227b"></a><a href="#footnote227b"
class="citation">[227b]</a>&nbsp; I have not heard anything of it
here; but I shall not be always able to defend him.&nbsp; We hear
your Bishop Hickman is dead; <a name="citation227c"></a><a
href="#footnote227c" class="citation">[227c]</a> but nobody here
will do anything for me in Ireland; so they may die as fast or
slow as they please.&mdash;Well, you are constant to your deans,
and your Stoyte, and your Walls.&nbsp; Walls will have her tea
soon; Parson Richardson is either going or gone to Ireland, and
has it with him.&nbsp; I hear Mr. Lewis has two letters for me: I
could not call for them to-day, but will to-morrow; and perhaps
one of them may be from our little MD, who knows, man? who can
tell?&nbsp; Many a more unlikely thing has happened.&mdash;Pshaw,
I write so plaguy little, I can hardly see it myself.&nbsp;
<i>Write bigger</i>, <i>sirrah</i> <a name="citation227d"></a><a
href="#footnote227d" class="citation">[227d]</a> Presto.&nbsp;
No, but I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Oh, you are a saucy rogue, Mr.
Presto, you are so impudent.&nbsp; <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>Come, dear rogues, let Presto go to
sleep; I have been with the Dean, and &rsquo;tis near twelve.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; I am so hot and lazy after my morning&rsquo;s walk,
that I loitered at Mrs. Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s, where my best gown
and periwig are, and out of mere listlessness dine there very
often; so I did to-day; but I got little MD&rsquo;s letter, N. 15
(you see, sirrahs, I remember to tell the number), from Mr.
Lewis, and I read it in a closet they lend me at Mrs.
Van&rsquo;s; and I find Stella is a saucy rogue and a great
writer, and can write finely still when her hand is in, and her
pen good.&nbsp; When I came here to-night, I had a mighty mind to
go swim after I was cool, for my lodging is just by the river;
and I went down with only my nightgown and slippers on at eleven,
but came up again; however, one of these nights I will
venture.</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; I was so hot this morning with my walk, that I
resolve to do so no more during this violent burning
weather.&nbsp; It is comical that now we happen to have such heat
to ripen the fruit there has been the greatest blast that was
ever known, and almost all the fruit is despaired of.&nbsp; I
dined with Lord Shelburne: Lady Kerry and Mrs. Pratt are going to
Ireland.&nbsp; I went this evening to Lord Treasurer, and sat
about two hours with him in mixed company; he left us, and went
to Court, and carried two staves with him, so I suppose we shall
have a new Lord Steward or Comptroller to-morrow; I smoked that
State secret out by that accident.&nbsp; I will not answer your
letter yet, sirrahs; no I won&rsquo;t, madam.</p>
<p>June 1.&nbsp; I wish you a merry month of June.&nbsp; I dined
again with the Vans and Sir Andrew Fountaine.&nbsp; I always give
them a flask of my Florence, which now begins to spoil, but it is
near an end.&nbsp; I went this afternoon to Mrs. Vedeau&rsquo;s,
and brought away Madam Dingley&rsquo;s parchment and letter of
attorney.&nbsp; Mrs. Vedeau tells me she has sent the bill a
fortnight ago.&nbsp; I will give the parchment to Ben Tooke, and
you shall send him a letter of attorney at your leisure, enclosed
to Mr. Presto.&nbsp; Yes, I now think your mackerel is full as
good as ours, which I did not think formerly.&nbsp; I was bit
about two staves, for there is no new officer made to-day.&nbsp;
This <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>letter will find you still in Dublin, I suppose, or at
Donnybrook, or losing your money at Walls&rsquo; (how does she
do?).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I missed this day by a blunder and dining in the
City. <a name="citation229a"></a><a href="#footnote229a"
class="citation">[229a]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; No boats on Sunday, never: so I was forced to walk,
and so hot by the time I got to Ford&rsquo;s lodging that I was
quite spent; I think the weather is mad.&nbsp; I could not go to
church.&nbsp; I dined with the Secretary as usual, and old
Colonel Graham <a name="citation229b"></a><a href="#footnote229b"
class="citation">[229b]</a> that lived at Bagshot Heath, and they
said it was Colonel Graham&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Pshaw, I remember
it very well, when I used to go for a walk to London from Moor
Park.&nbsp; What, I warrant you do not remember the Golden Farmer
<a name="citation229c"></a><a href="#footnote229c"
class="citation">[229c]</a> neither, figgarkick soley? <a
name="citation229d"></a><a href="#footnote229d"
class="citation">[229d]</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; When must we answer this letter, this N. 15 of our
little MD?&nbsp; Heat and laziness, and Sir Andrew Fountaine,
made me dine to-day again at Mrs. Van&rsquo;s; and, in short,
this weather is unsupportable: how is it with you?&nbsp; Lady
Betty Butler and Lady Ashburnham sat with me two or three hours
this evening in my closet at Mrs. Van&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They are
very good girls; and if Lady Betty went to Ireland, you should
let her be acquainted with you.&nbsp; How does Dingley do this
hot weather?&nbsp; Stella, I think, never complains of it; she
loves hot weather.&nbsp; There has not been a drop of rain since
Friday se&rsquo;ennight.&nbsp; Yes, you do love hot weather,
naughty Stella, you do so; and Presto can&rsquo;t abide it.&nbsp;
Be a good girl then, and I will love you; and love one another,
and don&rsquo;t be quarrelling girls.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I dined in the City to-day, and went from hence early
to town, and visited the Duke of Ormond and Mr. Secretary.&nbsp;
They say my Lord Treasurer has a dead warrant in his <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>pocket;
they mean a list of those who are to be turned out of employment;
and we every day now expect those changes.&nbsp; I passed by the
Treasury to-day, and saw vast crowds waiting to give Lord
Treasurer petitions as he passes by.&nbsp; He is now at the top
of power and favour: he keeps no levees yet.&nbsp; I am cruel
thirsty this hot weather.&mdash;I am just this minute going to
swim.&nbsp; I take Patrick down with me, to hold my nightgown,
shirt, and slippers, and borrow a napkin of my landlady for a
cap.&nbsp; So farewell till I come up; but there is no danger,
don&rsquo;t be frighted.&mdash;I have been swimming this
half-hour and more; and when I was coming out I dived, to make my
head and all through wet, like a cold bath; but, as I dived, the
napkin fell off and is lost, and I have that to pay for.&nbsp; O,
faith, the great stones were so sharp, I could hardly set my feet
on them as I came out.&nbsp; It was pure and warm.&nbsp; I got to
bed, and will now go sleep.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; This letter shall go to-morrow; so I
will answer yours when I come home to-night.&nbsp; I feel no hurt
from last night&rsquo;s swimming.&nbsp; I lie with nothing but
the sheet over me, and my feet quite bare.&nbsp; I must rise and
go to town before the tide is against me.&nbsp; Morrow, sirrahs;
dear sirrahs, morrow.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I never felt so hot a
day as this since I was born.&nbsp; I dined with Lady Betty
Germaine, and there was the young Earl of Berkeley <a
name="citation230a"></a><a href="#footnote230a"
class="citation">[230a]</a> and his fine lady.&nbsp; I never saw
her before, nor think her near so handsome as she passes
for.&mdash;After dinner, Mr. Bertue <a name="citation230b"></a><a
href="#footnote230b" class="citation">[230b]</a> would not let me
put ice in my wine, but said my Lord Dorchester <a
name="citation230c"></a><a href="#footnote230c"
class="citation">[230c]</a> got the bloody flux with it, and that
it was the worst thing in the world.&nbsp; Thus are we plagued,
thus are we plagued; yet I have done it five or six times this
summer, and was but the drier and the hotter for it.&nbsp;
Nothing makes me so excessively peevish as hot weather.&nbsp;
Lady Berkeley after dinner clapped my hat on <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>another
lady&rsquo;s head, and she in roguery put it upon the
rails.&nbsp; I minded them not; but in two minutes they called me
to the window, and Lady Carteret <a name="citation231a"></a><a
href="#footnote231a" class="citation">[231a]</a> showed me my hat
out of her window five doors off, where I was forced to walk to
it, and pay her and old Lady Weymouth <a
name="citation231b"></a><a href="#footnote231b"
class="citation">[231b]</a> a visit, with some more
beldames.&nbsp; Then I went and drank coffee, and made one or two
puns, with Lord Pembroke, <a name="citation231c"></a><a
href="#footnote231c" class="citation">[231c]</a> and designed to
go to Lord Treasurer; but it was too late, and beside I was half
broiled, and broiled without butter; for I never sweat after
dinner, if I drink any wine.&nbsp; Then I sat an hour with Lady
Betty Butler at tea, and everything made me hotter and
drier.&nbsp; Then I walked home, and was here by ten, so
miserably hot, that I was in as perfect a passion as ever I was
in my life at the greatest affront or provocation.&nbsp; Then I
sat an hour, till I was quite dry and cool enough to go swim;
which I did, but with so much vexation that I think I have given
it over: for I was every moment disturbed by boats, rot them; and
that puppy Patrick, standing ashore, would let them come within a
yard or two, and then call sneakingly to them.&nbsp; The only
comfort I proposed here in hot weather is gone; for there is no
jesting with those boats after it is dark: I had none last
night.&nbsp; I dived to dip my head, and held my cap on with both
my hands, for fear of losing it.&nbsp; Pox take the boats!&nbsp;
Amen.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis near twelve, and so I&rsquo;ll answer your
letter (it strikes twelve now) to-morrow morning.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Well, now let us answer MD&rsquo;s
letter, N. 15, 15, 15, 15.&nbsp; Now have I told you the
number?&nbsp; 15, 15; there, impudence, to call names in the
beginning of your letter, before you say, How do you do, Mr.
Presto?&nbsp; There is your breeding!&nbsp; Where is your
manners, sirrah, to a gentleman?&nbsp; Get you gone, you couple
of jades.&mdash;No, I never sit up late now; but this abominable
hot weather will force me to eat or drink something that will do
me hurt.&nbsp; I do venture <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>to eat a few strawberries.&mdash;Why
then, do you know in Ireland that Mr. St. John talked so in
Parliament? <a name="citation232a"></a><a href="#footnote232a"
class="citation">[232a]</a>&nbsp; Your Whigs are plaguily bit;
for he is entirely for their being all out.&mdash;And are you as
vicious in snuff as ever?&nbsp; I believe, as you say, it does
neither hurt nor good; but I have left it off, and when anybody
offers me their box, I take about a tenth part of what I used to
do, and then just smell to it, and privately fling the rest
away.&nbsp; I keep to my tobacco still, <a
name="citation232b"></a><a href="#footnote232b"
class="citation">[232b]</a> as you say; but even much less of
that than formerly, only mornings and evenings, and very seldom
in the day.&mdash;As for Joe, <a name="citation232c"></a><a
href="#footnote232c" class="citation">[232c]</a> I have
recommended his case heartily to my Lord Lieutenant; and, by his
direction, given a memorial of it to Mr. Southwell, to whom I
have recommended it likewise.&nbsp; I can do no more, if he were
my brother.&nbsp; His business will be to apply himself to
Southwell.&nbsp; And you must desire Raymond, if Price of Galway
comes to town, to desire him to wait on Mr. Southwell, as
recommended by me for one of the Duke&rsquo;s chaplains, which
was all I could do for him; and he must be presented to the Duke,
and make his court, and ply about, and find out some vacancy, and
solicit early for it.&nbsp; The bustle about your Mayor I had
before, as I told you, from the Archbishop of Dublin.&nbsp; Was
Raymond not come till May 18?&nbsp; So he says fine things of
me?&nbsp; Certainly he lies.&nbsp; I am sure I used him
indifferently enough; and we never once dined together, or
walked, or were in any third place; only he came sometimes to my
lodgings, and even there was oftener denied than
admitted.&mdash;What an odd bill is that you sent of
Raymond&rsquo;s!&nbsp; A bill upon one Murry in Chester, which
depends entirely not only upon Raymond&rsquo;s honesty, but his
discretion; and in money matters he is the last man I would
depend on.&nbsp; Why should Sir Alexander Cairnes <a
name="citation232d"></a><a href="#footnote232d"
class="citation">[232d]</a> in London pay me a bill, drawn <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>by God
knows who, upon Murry in Chester?&nbsp; I was at Cairnes&rsquo;s,
and they can do no such thing.&nbsp; I went among some friends,
who are merchants, and I find the bill must be sent to Murry,
accepted by him, and then returned back, and then Cairnes may
accept or refuse it as he pleases.&nbsp; Accordingly I gave Sir
Thomas Frankland the bill, who has sent it to Chester, and
ordered the postmaster there to get it accepted, and then send it
back, and in a day or two I shall have an answer; and therefore
this letter must stay a day or two longer than I intended, and
see what answer I get.&nbsp; Raymond should have written to Murry
at the same time, to desire Sir Alexander Cairnes to have
answered such a bill, if it come.&nbsp; But Cairnes&rsquo;s
clerks (himself was not at home) said they had received no notice
of it, and could do nothing; and advised me to send to
Murry.&mdash;I have been six weeks to-day at Chelsea, and you
know it but just now.&nbsp; And so Dean &mdash; thinks I write
the <i>Medley</i>.&nbsp; Pox of his judgment!&nbsp; It is equal
to his honesty.&nbsp; Then you han&rsquo;t seen the
<i>Miscellany</i> yet? <a name="citation233a"></a><a
href="#footnote233a" class="citation">[233a]</a>&nbsp; Why,
&rsquo;tis a four-shilling book: has nobody carried it
over?&mdash;No, I believe Manley <a name="citation233b"></a><a
href="#footnote233b" class="citation">[233b]</a> will not lose
his place; for his friend <a name="citation233c"></a><a
href="#footnote233c" class="citation">[233c]</a> in England is so
far from being out that he has taken a new patent since the Post
Office Act; and his brother Jack Manley <a
name="citation233d"></a><a href="#footnote233d"
class="citation">[233d]</a> here takes his part firmly; and I
have often spoken to Southwell in his behalf, and he seems very
well inclined to him.&nbsp; But the Irish folks here in general
are horribly violent against him.&nbsp; Besides, he must consider
he could not send Stella wine if he were put out.&nbsp; And so he
is very kind, and sends you a dozen bottles of wine <i>at a
time</i>, and you win eight shillings <i>at a time</i>; and how
much do you lose?&nbsp; No, no, never one syllable about that, I
warrant you.&mdash;Why, this same Stella is so unmerciful a
writer, she has hardly left any room for Dingley.&nbsp; If you
have such summer there as here, sure the Wexford waters are good
by this time.&nbsp; I forgot what weather we had May 6th; go look
in my journal.&nbsp; We had terrible rain the 24th and <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>25th, and
never a drop since.&nbsp; Yes, yes, I remember Berested&rsquo;s
bridge; the coach sosses up and down as one goes that way, just
as at Hockley-in-the-Hole. <a name="citation234a"></a><a
href="#footnote234a" class="citation">[234a]</a>&nbsp; I never
impute any illness or health I have to good or ill weather, but
to want of exercise, or ill air, or something I have eaten, or
hard study, or sitting up; and so I fence against those as well
as I can: but who a deuce can help the weather?&nbsp; Will
Seymour, <a name="citation234b"></a><a href="#footnote234b"
class="citation">[234b]</a> the General, was excessively hot with
the sun shining full upon him; so he turns to the sun, and says,
&ldquo;Harkee, friend, you had better go and ripen cucumbers than
plague me at this rate,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; Another time, fretting
at the heat, a gentleman by said it was such weather as pleased
God: Seymour said, &ldquo;Perhaps it may; but I am sure it
pleases nobody else.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, Madam Dingley, the
First-Fruits are done.&nbsp; Southwell told me they went to
inquire about them, and Lord Treasurer said they were done, and
had been done long ago.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll tell you a secret
you must not mention, that the Duke of Ormond is ordered to take
notice of them in his speech in your Parliament: and I desire you
will take care to say on occasion that my Lord Treasurer Harley
did it many months ago, before the Duke was Lord
Lieutenant.&nbsp; And yet I cannot possibly come over yet: so get
you gone to Wexford, and make Stella well. Yes, yes, I take care
not to walk late; I never did but once, and there are five
hundred people on the way as I walk. Tisdall is a puppy, and I
will excuse him the half-hour he would talk with me.&nbsp; As for
the <i>Examiner</i>, I have heard a whisper that after that of
this day, <a name="citation234c"></a><a href="#footnote234c"
class="citation">[234c]</a> which tells us what this Parliament
has done, you will hardly find them so good.&nbsp; I prophesy
they will be trash for the future; and methinks in this
day&rsquo;s <i>Examiner</i> the author talks doubtfully, as if he
would <a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>write no more. <a name="citation235a"></a><a
href="#footnote235a" class="citation">[235a]</a>&nbsp; Observe
whether the change be discovered in Dublin, only for your own
curiosity, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Make a mouth there.&nbsp; Mrs.
Vedeau&rsquo;s business I have answered, and I hope the bill is
not lost.&nbsp; Morrow.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis stewing hot, but I must
rise and go to town between fire and water.&nbsp; Morrow, sirrahs
both, morrow.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Colonel
Crowe, Governor of Jamaica, and your friend Sterne.&nbsp; I
presented Sterne to my Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s brother, <a
name="citation235b"></a><a href="#footnote235b"
class="citation">[235b]</a> and gave him his case, and engaged
him in his favour.&nbsp; At dinner there fell the swingingest
long shower, and the most grateful to me, that ever I saw: it
thundered fifty times at least, and the air is so cool that a
body is able to live; and I walked home to-night with comfort,
and without dirt.&nbsp; I went this evening to Lord Treasurer,
and sat with him two hours, and we were in very good humour, and
he abused me, and called me Dr. Thomas Swift fifty times: I have
told you he does that when he has mind to make me mad. <a
name="citation235c"></a><a href="#footnote235c"
class="citation">[235c]</a>&nbsp; Sir Thomas Frankland gave me
to-day a letter from Murry, accepting my bill; so all is well:
only, by a letter from Parvisol, I find there are some
perplexities.&mdash;Joe has likewise written to me, to thank me
for what I have done for him; and desires I would write to the
Bishop of Clogher, that Tom Ashe <a name="citation235d"></a><a
href="#footnote235d" class="citation">[235d]</a> may not hinder
his father <a name="citation235e"></a><a href="#footnote235e"
class="citation">[235e]</a> from being portreve.&nbsp; I have
written and sent to Joe several times, that I will not trouble
myself at all about Trim.&nbsp; I wish them their liberty, but
they do not deserve it: so tell Joe, and send to him.&nbsp; I am
mighty happy with this rain: I was at the end of my patience, but
now I live again.&nbsp; This cannot go till Saturday; and perhaps
I may go out of town with Lord Shelburne and Lady Kerry to-morrow
for two or <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>three days.&nbsp; Lady Kerry has written to desire it;
but to-morrow I shall know farther.&mdash;O this dear rain, I
cannot forbear praising it: I never felt myself to be revived so
in my life.&nbsp; It lasted from three till five, hard as a horn,
and mixed with hail.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I am going to town, and will just
finish this there, if I go into the country with Lady Kerry and
Lord Shelburne: so morrow, till an hour or two hence.&mdash;In
town.&nbsp; I met Cairnes, who, I suppose, will pay me the money;
though he says I must send him the bill first, and I will get it
done in absence.&nbsp; Farewell, etc. etc.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Chelsea</span>,
<i>June</i> 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> been all this time at
Wycombe, between Oxford and London, with Lord Shelburne, who has
the squire&rsquo;s house at the town&rsquo;s end, and an estate
there in a delicious country.&nbsp; Lady Kerry and Mrs. Pratt
were with us, and we passed our time well enough; and there I
wholly disengaged myself from all public thoughts, and everything
but MD, who had the impudence to send me a letter there; but
I&rsquo;ll be revenged: I will answer it.&nbsp; This day, the
20th, I came from Wycombe with Lady Kerry after dinner, lighted
at Hyde Park Corner, and walked: it was twenty-seven miles, and
we came it in about five hours.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; I went at noon to see Mr. Secretary at his office,
and there was Lord Treasurer: so I killed two birds, etc., and we
were glad to see one another, and so forth.&nbsp; And the
Secretary and I dined at Sir William Wyndham&rsquo;s, <a
name="citation236"></a><a href="#footnote236"
class="citation">[236]</a> who married Lady Catharine Seymour,
your acquaintance, I <a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>suppose.&nbsp; There were ten of us
at dinner.&nbsp; It seems, in my absence, they had erected a
Club, <a name="citation237a"></a><a href="#footnote237a"
class="citation">[237a]</a> and made me one; and we made some
laws to-day, which I am to digest and add to, against next
meeting.&nbsp; Our meetings are to be every Thursday.&nbsp; We
are yet but twelve: Lord Keeper and Lord Treasurer were proposed;
but I was against them, and so was Mr. Secretary, though their
sons are of it, and so they are excluded; but we design to admit
the Duke of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The end of our Club is, to advance
conversation and friendship, and to reward deserving persons with
our interest and recommendation.&nbsp; We take in none but men of
wit or men of interest; and if we go on as we begin, no other
Club in this town will be worth talking of.&nbsp; The
Solicitor-General, Sir Robert Raymond, is one of our Club; and I
ordered him immediately to write to your Lord Chancellor in
favour of Dr. Raymond: so tell Raymond, if you see him; but I
believe this will find you at Wexford.&nbsp; This letter will
come three weeks after the last, so there is a week lost; but
that is owing to my being out of town; yet I think it is right,
because it goes enclosed to Mr. Reading: <a
name="citation237b"></a><a href="#footnote237b"
class="citation">[237b]</a> and why should he know how often
Presto writes to MD, pray?&mdash;I sat this evening with Lady
Betty Butler and Lady Ashburnham, and then came home by eleven,
and had a good cool walk; for we have had no extreme hot weather
this fortnight, but a great deal of rain at times, and a body can
live and breathe.&nbsp; I hope it will hold so.&nbsp; We had
peaches to-day.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; I went late to-day to town, and dined with my friend
Lewis.&nbsp; I saw Will Congreve attending at the Treasury, by
order, with his brethren, the Commissioners of the Wine
Licences.&nbsp; I had often mentioned him with kindness to Lord
Treasurer; and Congreve told me that, after they had answered to
what they were sent for, my lord called him privately, and spoke
to him with great kindness, promising his protection, etc.&nbsp;
The poor man said he had been used so <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>ill of late years that he was quite
astonished at my lord&rsquo;s goodness, etc., and desired me to
tell my lord so; which I did this evening, and recommended him
heartily.&nbsp; My lord assured me he esteemed him very much, and
would be always kind to him; that what he said was to make
Congreve easy, because he knew people talked as if his lordship
designed to turn everybody out, and particularly Congreve: which
indeed was true, for the poor man told me he apprehended
it.&nbsp; As I left my Lord Treasurer, I called on Congreve
(knowing where he dined), and told him what had passed between my
lord and me; so I have made a worthy man easy, and that is a good
day&rsquo;s work. <a name="citation238a"></a><a
href="#footnote238a" class="citation">[238a]</a>&nbsp; I am
proposing to my lord to erect a society or academy for correcting
and settling our language, that we may not perpetually be
changing as we do.&nbsp; He enters mightily into it, so does the
Dean of Carlisle; <a name="citation238b"></a><a
href="#footnote238b" class="citation">[238b]</a> and I design to
write a letter to Lord Treasurer with the proposals of it, and
publish it; <a name="citation238c"></a><a href="#footnote238c"
class="citation">[238c]</a> and so I told my lord, and he
approves it.&nbsp; Yesterday&rsquo;s <a
name="citation238d"></a><a href="#footnote238d"
class="citation">[238d]</a> was a sad <i>Examiner</i>, and last
week was very indifferent, though some little scraps of the old
spirit, as if he had given some hints; but yesterday&rsquo;s is
all trash.&nbsp; It is plain the hand is changed.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; I have not been in London to-day: for Dr. Gastrell
<a name="citation238e"></a><a href="#footnote238e"
class="citation">[238e]</a> and I dined, by invitation, with the
Dean of Carlisle, my neighbour; so I know not what they are doing
in the world, a mere country gentleman.&nbsp; And are not you
ashamed both to go into the country just when I did, and stay ten
days, just as I did, saucy monkeys?&nbsp; But I never rode; I had
no horses, and our coach was out of order, and we went and came
in a hired one.&nbsp; Do you keep your lodgings when you <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>go to
Wexford?&nbsp; I suppose you do; for you will hardly stay above
two months.&nbsp; I have been walking about our town to-night,
and it is a very scurvy place for walking.&nbsp; I am thinking to
leave it, and return to town, now the Irish folks are gone.&nbsp;
Ford goes in three days.&nbsp; How does Dingley divert herself
while Stella is riding? work, or read, or walk?&nbsp; Does
Dingley ever read to you?&nbsp; Had you ever a book with you in
the country?&nbsp; Is all that left off?&nbsp; Confess.&nbsp;
Well, I&rsquo;ll go sleep; &rsquo;tis past eleven, and I go early
to sleep: I write nothing at night but to MD.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; Stratford and I, and Pastoral Philips (just come
from Denmark) dined at Ford&rsquo;s to-day, who paid his way, and
goes for Ireland on Tuesday.&nbsp; The Earl of Peterborow is
returned from Vienna without one servant: he left them scattered
in several towns of Germany.&nbsp; I had a letter from him, four
days ago, from Hanover, where he desires I would immediately send
him an answer to his house at Parson&rsquo;s Green, <a
name="citation239"></a><a href="#footnote239"
class="citation">[239]</a> about five miles off.&nbsp; I wondered
what he meant, till I heard he was come.&nbsp; He sent expresses,
and got here before them.&nbsp; He is above fifty, and as active
as one of five-and-twenty.&nbsp; I have not seen him yet, nor
know when I shall, or where to find him.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; Poor Duke of Shrewsbury has been very ill of a
fever: we were all in a fright about him: I thank God, he is
better.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Lord Ashburnham&rsquo;s, with his
lady, for he was not at home: she is a very good girl, and always
a great favourite of mine.&nbsp; Sterne tells me he has desired a
friend to receive your box in Chester, and carry it over.&nbsp; I
fear he will miscarry in his business, which was sent to the
Treasury before he was recommended; for I was positive only to
second his recommendations, and all his other friends failed
him.&nbsp; However, on your account I will do what I can for him
to-morrow with the secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; We had much company to-day at dinner at Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Prior never fails: he is a much better
courtier than I; and we expect every day that he will be a
Commissioner <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>of the Customs, and that in a short time a great many
more will be turned out.&nbsp; They blame Lord Treasurer for his
slowness in turning people out; but I suppose he has his
reasons.&nbsp; They still keep my neighbour Atterbury in suspense
about the deanery of Christ Church, <a name="citation240a"></a><a
href="#footnote240a" class="citation">[240a]</a> which has been
above six months vacant, and he is heartily angry.&nbsp; I reckon
you are now preparing for your Wexford expedition; and poor
Dingley is full of carking and caring, scolding.&nbsp; How long
will you stay?&nbsp; Shall I be in Dublin before you
return?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t fall and hurt yourselves, nor overturn
the coach.&nbsp; Love one another, and be good girls; and drink
Presto&rsquo;s health in water, Madam Stella; and in good ale,
Madam Dingley.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; The Secretary appointed me to dine with him to-day,
and we were to do a world of business: he came at four, and
brought Prior with him, and had forgot the appointment, and no
business was done.&nbsp; I left him at eight, and went to change
my gown at Mrs. Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s; and there was Sir Andrew
Fountaine at ombre with Lady Ashburnham and Lady Frederic
Schomberg, and Lady Mary Schomberg, <a name="citation240b"></a><a
href="#footnote240b" class="citation">[240b]</a> and Lady Betty
Butler, and others, talking; and it put me in mind of the Dean
and Stoyte, and Walls, and Stella at play, and Dingley and I
looking on.&nbsp; I stayed with them till ten, like a fool.&nbsp;
Lady Ashburnham is something like Stella; so I helped her, and
wished her good cards.&nbsp; It is late, etc.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; Well, but I must answer this letter of our
MD&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Saturday approaches, and I han&rsquo;t written
down this side.&nbsp; O, faith, Presto has been a sort of a lazy
fellow: but Presto will remove to town this day se&rsquo;ennight;
the Secretary has commanded me to do so; and I believe he and I
shall go for some days to Windsor, where he will have leisure to
mind some business we have together.&nbsp; To-day, our Society
(it must not be called a Club) dined at Mr. Secretary&rsquo;s: we
were but eight; the rest sent excuses, or were out of town.&nbsp;
<a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>We sat
till eight, and made some laws and settlements; and then I went
to take leave of Lady Ashburnham, who goes out of town to-morrow,
as a great many of my acquaintance are already, and left the town
very thin.&nbsp; I shall make but short journeys this summer, and
not be long out of London.&nbsp; The days are grown sensibly
short already, all our fruit blasted.&nbsp; Your Duke of Ormond
is still at Chester; and perhaps this letter will be with you as
soon as he.&nbsp; Sterne&rsquo;s business is quite blown up: they
stand to it to send him back to the Commissioners of the Revenue
in Ireland for a reference, and all my credit could not alter it,
though I almost fell out with the secretary of the Treasury, <a
name="citation241"></a><a href="#footnote241"
class="citation">[241]</a> who is my Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s
cousin-germain, and my very good friend.&nbsp; It seems every
step he has hitherto taken hath been wrong; at least they say so,
and that is the same thing.&nbsp; I am heartily sorry for it; and
I really think they are in the wrong, and use him hardly; but I
can do no more.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; Steele has had the assurance to write to me that I
would engage my Lord Treasurer to keep a friend of his in an
employment: I believe I told you how he and Addison served me for
my good offices in Steele&rsquo;s behalf; and I promised Lord
Treasurer never to speak for either of them again.&nbsp; Sir
Andrew Fountaine and I dined to-day at Mrs.
Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Dilly Ashe has been in town this
fortnight: I saw him twice; he was four days at Lord
Pembroke&rsquo;s in the country, punning with him; his face is
very well.&nbsp; I was this evening two or three hours at Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s, who called me Dr. Thomas Swift twenty times;
that&rsquo;s his way of teasing.&nbsp; I left him at nine, and
got home here by ten, like a gentleman; and to-morrow morning
I&rsquo;ll answer your little letter, sirrahs.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I am terribly sleepy always in a
morning; I believe it is my walk over-night that disposes me to
sleep: faith, &rsquo;tis now striking eight, and I am but just
awake.&nbsp; Patrick comes early, and wakes me five or six times;
but I have excuses, though I am three parts asleep.&nbsp; I tell
him I <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>sat up late, or slept ill in the night, and often it is
a lie.&nbsp; I have now got little MD&rsquo;s letter before me,
N. 16, no more, nor no less, no mistake.&nbsp; Dingley says,
&ldquo;This letter won&rsquo;t be above six lines&rdquo;; and I
was afraid it was true, though I saw it filled on both
sides.&nbsp; The Bishop of Clogher writ me word you were in the
country, and that he heard you were well: I am glad at heart MD
rides, and rides, and rides.&nbsp; Our hot weather ended in May,
and all this month has been moderate: it was then so hot I was
not able to endure it; I was miserable every moment, and found
myself disposed to be peevish and quarrelsome: I believe a very
hot country would make me stark mad.&mdash;Yes, my head continues
pretty tolerable, and I impute it all to walking.&nbsp; Does
Stella eat fruit?&nbsp; I eat a little; but I always repent, and
resolve against it.&nbsp; No, in very hot weather I always go to
town by water; but I constantly walk back, for then the sun is
down.&nbsp; And so Mrs. Proby <a name="citation242"></a><a
href="#footnote242" class="citation">[242]</a> goes with you to
Wexford: she&rsquo;s admirable company; you&rsquo;ll grow plaguy
wise with those you frequent.&nbsp; Mrs. Taylor and Mrs. Proby!
take care of infection.&nbsp; I believe my two hundred pounds
will be paid, but that Sir Alexander Cairnes is a scrupulous
puppy: I left the bill with Mr. Stratford, who is to have the
money.&nbsp; Now, Madam Stella, what say you? you ride every day;
I know that already, sirrah; and, if you rid every day for a
twelvemonth, you would be still better and better.&nbsp; No, I
hope Parvisol will not have the impudence to make you stay an
hour for the money; if he does, I&rsquo;ll <i>un-parvisol</i>
him; pray let me know.&nbsp; O Lord, how hasty we are!&nbsp;
Stella can&rsquo;t stay writing and writing; she must write and
go a cock-horse, pray now.&nbsp; Well, but the horses are not
come to the door; the fellow can&rsquo;t find the bridle; your
stirrup is broken; where did you put the whips, Dingley?&nbsp;
Marget, where have you laid Mrs. Johnson&rsquo;s ribbon to tie
about her? reach me my mask: sup up this before you go.&nbsp; So,
so, a gallop, a gallop: sit fast, sirrah, and don&rsquo;t ride
hard upon the stones.&mdash;Well, now Stella is gone, tell me,
Dingley, is she a good girl? and what <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>news is that you are to tell
me?&mdash;No, I believe the box is not lost: Sterne says it is
not.&mdash;No, faith, you must go to Wexford without seeing your
Duke of Ormond, unless you stay on purpose; perhaps you may be so
wise.&mdash;I tell you this is your sixteenth letter; will you
never be satisfied?&nbsp; No, no, I will walk late no more; I
ought less to venture it than other people, and so I was told:
but I will return to lodge in town next Thursday.&nbsp; When you
come from Wexford, I would have you send a letter of attorney to
Mr. Benjamin Tooke, bookseller, in London, directed to me; and he
shall manage your affair.&nbsp; I have your parchment safely
locked up in London.&mdash;O, Madam Stella, welcome home; was it
pleasant riding? did your horse stumble? how often did the man
light to settle your stirrup? ride nine miles! faith, you have
galloped indeed.&nbsp; Well, but where is the fine thing you
promised me?&nbsp; I have been a good boy, ask Dingley
else.&nbsp; I believe you did not meet the fine-thing-man: faith,
you are a cheat.&nbsp; So you will see Raymond and his wife in
town.&nbsp; Faith, that riding to Laracor gives me short sighs,
as well as you.&nbsp; All the days I have passed here have been
dirt to those.&nbsp; I have been gaining enemies by the scores,
and friends by the couples; which is against the rules of wisdom,
because they say one enemy can do more hurt than ten friends can
do good.&nbsp; But I have had my revenge at least, if I get
nothing else.&nbsp; And so let Fate govern.&mdash;Now I think
your letter is answered; and mine will be shorter than ordinary,
because it must go to-day.&nbsp; We have had a great deal of
scattering rain for some days past, yet it hardly keeps down the
dust.&mdash;We have plays acted in our town; and Patrick was at
one of them, oh oh.&nbsp; He was damnably mauled one day when he
was drunk; he was at cuffs with a brother-footman, who dragged
him along the floor upon his face, which looked for a week after
as if he had the leprosy; and I was glad enough to see it.&nbsp;
I have been ten times sending him over to you; yet now he has new
clothes, and a laced hat, which the hatter brought by his orders,
and he offered to pay for the lace out of his wages.&mdash;I am
to dine <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>to-day with Dilly at Sir Andrew Fountaine&rsquo;s, who
has bought a new house, and will be weary of it in half a
year.&nbsp; I must rise and shave, and walk to town, unless I go
with the Dean in his chariot at twelve, which is too late: and I
have not seen that Lord Peterborow yet.&nbsp; The Duke of
Shrewsbury is almost well again, and will be abroad in a day or
two: what care you?&nbsp; There it is now: you do not care for my
friends.&nbsp; Farewell, my dearest lives and delights; I love
you better than ever, if possible, as hope saved, I do, and ever
will.&nbsp; God Almighty bless you ever, and make us happy
together!&nbsp; I pray for this twice every day; and I hope God
will hear my poor hearty prayers.&mdash;Remember, if I am used
ill and ungratefully, as I have formerly been, &rsquo;tis what I
am prepared for, and shall not wonder at it.&nbsp; Yet I am now
envied, and thought in high favour, and have every day numbers of
considerable men teasing me to solicit for them.&nbsp; And the
Ministry all use me perfectly well; and all that know them say
they love me.&nbsp; Yet I can count upon nothing, nor will, but
upon MD&rsquo;s love and kindness.&mdash;They think me useful;
they pretended they were afraid of none but me, and that they
resolved to have me; they have often confessed this: yet all
makes little impression on me.&mdash;Pox of these speculations!
they give me the spleen; and that is a disease I was not born
to.&nbsp; Let me alone, sirrahs, and be satisfied: I am, as long
as MD and Presto are well.</p>
<blockquote><p>Little wealth,<br />
And much health,<br />
And a life by stealth:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that is all we want; and so farewell, dearest MD; Stella,
Dingley, Presto, all together, now and for ever all
together.&nbsp; Farewell again and again.</p>

245</span>LETTER XXVI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Chelsea</span>,
<i>June</i> 30, 1711.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">See</span> what large paper I am forced to
take, to write to MD; Patrick has brought me none clipped; but,
faith, the next shall be smaller.&nbsp; I dined to-day, as I told
you, with Dilly at Sir Andrew Fountaine&rsquo;s: there were we
wretchedly punning, and writing together to Lord Pembroke.&nbsp;
Dilly is just such a puppy as ever; and it is so uncouth, after
so long an intermission.&nbsp; My twenty-fifth is gone this
evening to the post.&nbsp; I think I will direct my next (which
is this) to Mr. Curry&rsquo;s, and let them send it to Wexford;
and then the next enclosed to Reading.&nbsp; Instruct me how I
shall do.&nbsp; I long to hear from you from Wexford, and what
sort of place it is.&nbsp; The town grows very empty and
dull.&nbsp; This evening I have had a letter from Mr. Philips,
the pastoral poet, to get him a certain employment from Lord
Treasurer.&nbsp; I have now had almost all the Whig poets my
solicitors; and I have been useful to Congreve, Steele, and
Harrison: but I will do nothing for Philips; I find he is more a
puppy than ever, so don&rsquo;t solicit for him.&nbsp; Besides, I
will not trouble Lord Treasurer, unless upon some very
extraordinary occasion.</p>
<p>July 1.&nbsp; Dilly lies conveniently for me when I come to
town from Chelsea of a Sunday, and go to the Secretary&rsquo;s;
so I called at his lodgings this morning, and sent for my gown,
and dressed myself there.&nbsp; He had a letter from the Bishop,
with an account that you were set out for Wexford the morning he
writ, which was June 26, and he had the letter the 30th; that was
very quick: the Bishop says you design to stay there two months
or more.&nbsp; Dilly had also a letter from Tom Ashe, full of
Irish news; that your Lady Lyndon <a name="citation245a"></a><a
href="#footnote245a" class="citation">[245a]</a> is dead, and I
know not what besides of Dr. Coghill <a
name="citation245b"></a><a href="#footnote245b"
class="citation">[245b]</a> losing <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>his drab, etc.&nbsp; The Secretary
was gone to Windsor, and I dined with Mrs. Vanhomrigh.&nbsp; Lord
Treasurer is at Windsor too; they will be going and coming all
summer, while the Queen is there, and the town is empty, and I
fear I shall be sometimes forced to stoop beneath my dignity, and
send to the ale-house for a dinner.&nbsp; Well, sirrahs, had you
a good journey to Wexford? did you drink ale by the way? were you
never overturned? how many things did you forget? do you lie on
straw in your new town where you are?&nbsp; Cudshoe, <a
name="citation246"></a><a href="#footnote246"
class="citation">[246]</a> the next letter to Presto will be
dated from Wexford.&nbsp; What fine company have you there? what
new acquaintance have you got?&nbsp; You are to write constantly
to Mrs. Walls and Mrs. Stoyte: and the Dean said, &ldquo;Shall we
never hear from you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Dean,
we&rsquo;ll make bold to trouble you with a letter.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then at Wexford; when you meet a lady, &ldquo;Did your waters
pass well this morning, madam?&rdquo;&nbsp; Will Dingley drink
them too?&nbsp; Yes, I warrant; to get her a stomach.&nbsp; I
suppose you are all gamesters at Wexford.&nbsp; Do not lose your
money, sirrah, far from home.&nbsp; I believe I shall go to
Windsor in a few days; at least, the Secretary tells me so.&nbsp;
He has a small house there, with just room enough for him and me;
and I would be satisfied to pass a few days there
sometimes.&nbsp; Sirrahs, let me go to sleep, it is past twelve
in our town.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Sterne came to me this morning, and tells me he has
yet some hopes of compassing his business: he was with Tom
Harley, the secretary of the Treasury, and made him doubt a
little he was in the wrong; the poor man tells me it will almost
undo him if he fails.&nbsp; I called this morning to see Will
Congreve, who lives much by himself, is forced to read <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>for
amusement, and cannot do it without a magnifying-glass.&nbsp; I
have set him very well with the Ministry, and I hope he is in no
danger of losing his place.&nbsp; I dined in the City with Dr.
Freind, not among my merchants, but with a scrub instrument of
mischief of mine, whom I never mentioned to you, nor am like to
do.&nbsp; You two little saucy Wexfordians, you are now drinking
waters.&nbsp; You drink waters! you go fiddlestick.&nbsp; Pray
God send them to do you good; if not, faith, next summer you
shall come to the Bath.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Lord Peterborow desired to see me this morning at
nine; I had not seen him before since he came home.&nbsp; I met
Mrs. Manley <a name="citation247a"></a><a href="#footnote247a"
class="citation">[247a]</a> there, who was soliciting him to get
some pension or reward for her service in the cause, by writing
her <i>Atalantis</i>, and prosecution, etc., upon it.&nbsp; I
seconded her, and hope they will do something for the poor
woman.&nbsp; My lord kept me two hours upon politics: he comes
home very sanguine; he has certainly done great things at Savoy
and Vienna, by his negotiations: he is violent against a peace,
and finds true what I writ to him, that the Ministry seems for
it.&nbsp; He reasons well; yet I am for a peace.&nbsp; I took
leave of Lady Kerry, who goes to-morrow for Ireland; she picks up
Lord Shelburne and Mrs. Pratt at Lord Shelburne&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; I was this evening with Lord Treasurer: Tom Harley
was there, and whispered me that he began to doubt about
Sterne&rsquo;s business; I told him he would find he was in the
wrong.&nbsp; I sat two or three hours at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s;
he rallied me sufficiently upon my refusing to take him into our
Club, and told a judge who was with us that my name was Thomas
Swift.&nbsp; I had a mind to prevent Sir H. Belasyse <a
name="citation247b"></a><a href="#footnote247b"
class="citation">[247b]</a> <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>going to Spain, who is a most
covetous cur, and I fell a railing against avarice, and turned it
so that he smoked me, and named Belasyse.&nbsp; I went on, and
said it was a shame to send him; to which he agreed, but desired
I would name some who understood business, and do not love money,
for he could not find them.&nbsp; I said there was something in a
Treasurer different from other men; that we ought not to make a
man a Bishop who does not love divinity, or a General who does
not love war; and I wondered why the Queen would make a man Lord
Treasurer who does not love money.&nbsp; He was mightily pleased
with what I said.&nbsp; He was talking of the First-Fruits of
England, and I took occasion to tell him that I would not for a
thousand pounds anybody but he had got them for Ireland, who got
them for England too.&nbsp; He bid me consider what a thousand
pounds was; I said I would have him to know I valued a thousand
pounds as little as he valued a million.&mdash;Is it not silly to
write all this? but it gives you an idea what our conversation is
with mixed company.&nbsp; I have taken a lodging in Suffolk
Street, and go to it on Thursday; and design to walk the Park and
the town, to supply my walking here: yet I will walk here
sometimes too, in a visit now and then to the Dean. <a
name="citation248"></a><a href="#footnote248"
class="citation">[248]</a>&nbsp; When I was almost at home,
Patrick told me he had two letters for me, and gave them to me in
the dark, yet I could see one of them was from saucy MD.&nbsp; I
went to visit the Dean for half an hour; and then came home, and
first read the other letter, which was from the Bishop of
Clogher, who tells me the Archbishop of Dublin mentioned in a
full assembly of the clergy the Queen&rsquo;s granting the
First-Fruits, said it was done by the Lord Treasurer, and talked
much of my merit in it: but reading yours I find nothing of that:
perhaps the Bishop lies, out of a desire to please me.&nbsp; I
dined with Mrs. Vanhomrigh.&nbsp; Well, sirrahs, you are gone to
Wexford; but I&rsquo;ll follow you.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Sterne came to me again this morning, to advise about
reasons and memorials he is drawing up; and we went to <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>town by
water together; and having nothing to do, I stole into the City
to an instrument of mine, and then went to see poor Patty Rolt,
<a name="citation249a"></a><a href="#footnote249a"
class="citation">[249a]</a> who has been in town these two months
with a cousin of hers.&nbsp; Her life passes with boarding in
some country town as cheap as she can, and, when she runs out,
shifting to some cheaper place, or coming to town for a
month.&nbsp; If I were rich, I would ease her, which a little
thing would do.&nbsp; Some months ago I sent her a guinea, and it
patched up twenty circumstances.&nbsp; She is now going to
Berkhamstead in Hertfordshire.&nbsp; It has rained and hailed
prodigiously to-day, with some thunder.&nbsp; This is the last
night I lie at Chelsea; and I got home early, and sat two hours
with the Dean, and ate victuals, having had a very scurvy
dinner.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll answer your letter when I come to live
in town.&nbsp; You shall have a fine London answer: but first I
will go sleep, and dream of MD.</p>
<p>London, July 5.&nbsp; This day I left Chelsea for good
(that&rsquo;s a genteel phrase), and am got into Suffolk
Street.&nbsp; I dined to-day at our Society, and we are adjourned
for a month, because most of us go into the country: we dined at
Lord Keeper&rsquo;s with young Harcourt, and Lord Keeper was
forced to sneak off, and dine with Lord Treasurer, who had
invited the Secretary and me to dine with him; but we scorned to
leave our company, as George Granville did, whom we have
threatened to expel: however, in the evening I went to Lord
Treasurer, and, among other company, found a couple of judges
with him; one of them, Judge Powell, <a
name="citation249b"></a><a href="#footnote249b"
class="citation">[249b]</a> an old fellow with grey hairs, was
the merriest old gentleman I ever saw, spoke pleasant things, and
laughed and chuckled till he cried again.&nbsp; I stayed till
eleven, because I was not now to walk to Chelsea.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; An ugly rainy day.&nbsp; I was to visit Mrs. Barton,
then called at Mrs. Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s, where Sir Andrew
Fountaine and the rain kept me to dinner; and there did I loiter
all <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>the
afternoon, like a fool, out of perfect laziness, and the weather
not permitting me to walk: but I&rsquo;ll do so no more.&nbsp;
Are your waters at Wexford good in this rain?&nbsp; I long to
hear how you are established there, how and whom you visit, what
is your lodging, what are your entertainments.&nbsp; You are got
far southwards; but I think you must eat no fruit while you drink
the waters.&nbsp; I ate some Kentish cherries t&rsquo;other day,
and I repent it already; I have felt my head a little
disordered.&nbsp; We had not a hot day all June, or since, which
I reckon a mighty happiness.&nbsp; Have you left a direction with
Reading for Wexford?&nbsp; I will, as I said, direct this to
Curry&rsquo;s, and the next to Reading; or suppose I send this at
a venture straight to Wexford?&nbsp; It would vex me to have it
miscarry.&nbsp; I had a letter to-night from Parvisol, that White
has paid me most of my remaining money; and another from Joe,
that they have had their election at Trim, but not a word of who
is chosen portreeve. <a name="citation250a"></a><a
href="#footnote250a" class="citation">[250a]</a>&nbsp; Poor Joe
is full of complaints, says he has enemies, and fears he will
never get his two hundred pounds; and I fear so too, although I
have done what I could.&mdash;I&rsquo;ll answer your letter when
I think fit, when saucy Presto thinks fit, sirrahs.&nbsp; I am
not at leisure yet; when I have nothing to do, perhaps I may
vouchsafe.&mdash;O Lord, the two Wexford ladies; I&rsquo;ll go
dream of you both.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; It was the dismallest rainy day I ever saw: I went to
the Secretary in the morning, and he was gone to Windsor.&nbsp;
Then it began raining, and I struck in to Mrs.
Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s, and dined, and stayed till night very dull
and insipid.&nbsp; I hate this town in summer; I&rsquo;ll leave
it for a while, if I can have time.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; I have a fellow of your town, one Tisdall, <a
name="citation250b"></a><a href="#footnote250b"
class="citation">[250b]</a> lodges in the <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>same house
with me.&nbsp; Patrick told me Squire Tisdall and his lady lodged
here.&nbsp; I pretended I never heard of him; but I knew his ugly
face, and saw him at church in the next pew to me, and he often
looked for a bow, but it would not do.&nbsp; I think he lives in
Capel Street, and has an ugly fine wife in a fine coach.&nbsp;
Dr. Freind and I dined in the City by invitation, and I drank
punch, very good, but it makes me hot.&nbsp; People here are
troubled with agues by this continuance of wet, cold weather; but
I am glad to find the season so temperate.&nbsp; I was this
evening to see Will Congreve, who is a very agreeable
companion.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; I was to-day in the City, and dined with Mr.
Stratford, who tells me Sir Alexander Cairnes makes difficulties
about paying my bill; so that I cannot give order yet to Parvisol
to deliver up the bond to Dr. Raymond.&nbsp; To-morrow I shall
have a positive answer: that Cairnes is a shuffling scoundrel;
and several merchants have told me so: what can one expect from a
Scot and a fanatic?&nbsp; I was at Bateman&rsquo;s the
bookseller&rsquo;s, to see a fine old library he has bought; and
my fingers itched, as yours would do at a china-shop; but I
resisted, and found everything too dear, and I have fooled away
too much money that way already.&nbsp; So go and drink your
waters, saucy rogue, and make yourself well; and pray walk while
you are there: I have a notion there is never a good walk in
Ireland. <a name="citation251"></a><a href="#footnote251"
class="citation">[251]</a>&nbsp; Do you find all places without
trees?&nbsp; Pray observe the inhabitants about Wexford; they are
old English; see what they have particular in their manners,
names, and language: magpies have been always there, and nowhere
else in Ireland, till of late years.&nbsp; They say the cocks and
dogs go to sleep at noon, and so do the people.&nbsp; Write your
travels, and bring home good eyes and health.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord Treasurer: we did not sit
down till four.&nbsp; I despatched three businesses with him, and
forgot a fourth.&nbsp; I think I have got a friend an employment;
and besides I made him consent to let me bring Congreve to <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>dine with
him.&nbsp; You must understand I have a mind to do a small thing,
only turn out all the Queen&rsquo;s physicians; for in my
conscience they will soon kill her among them.&nbsp; And I must
talk over that matter with some people.&nbsp; My Lord Treasurer
told me the Queen and he between them have lost the paper about
the First-Fruits, but desires I will let the bishops know it
shall be done with the first opportunity.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; I dined to-day with neighbour Van, and walked pretty
well in the Park this evening.&nbsp; Stella, hussy, don&rsquo;t
you remember, sirrah, you used to reproach me about meddling in
other folk&rsquo;s affairs?&nbsp; I have enough of it now: two
people came to me to-night in the Park to engage to speak to Lord
Treasurer in their behalf, and I believe they make up fifty who
have asked me the same favour.&nbsp; I am hardened, and resolve
to trouble him, or any other Minister, less than ever.&nbsp; And
I observe those who have ten times more credit than I will not
speak a word for anybody.&nbsp; I met yesterday the poor lad I
told you of, who lived with Mr. Tenison, <a
name="citation252a"></a><a href="#footnote252a"
class="citation">[252a]</a> who has been ill of an ague ever
since I saw him.&nbsp; He looked wretchedly, and was exceeding
thankful for half a crown I gave him.&nbsp; He had a crown from
me before.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; I dined to-day with young Manley <a
name="citation252b"></a><a href="#footnote252b"
class="citation">[252b]</a> in the City, who is to get me out a
box of books and a hamper of wine from Hamburg.&nbsp; I inquired
of Mr. Stratford, who tells me that Cairnes has not yet paid my
two hundred pounds, but shams and delays from day to day.&nbsp;
Young Manley&rsquo;s wife is a very indifferent person of a young
woman, goggle-eyed, and looks like a fool: yet he is a handsome
fellow, and married her for love after long courtship, and she
refused him until he got his last employment.&mdash;I believe I
shall not be so good a boy for writing as I was during your stay
at Wexford, unless I may send my letters every second time to
Curry&rsquo;s; pray let me know.&nbsp; This, I think, shall go
there: or why not to Wexford itself?&nbsp; That is right, and so
it shall this next Tuesday, although it costs you tenpence.&nbsp;
What care I?</p>
<p><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>13.&nbsp; This toad of a Secretary is come from
Windsor, and I cannot find him; and he goes back on Sunday, and I
can&rsquo;t see him to-morrow.&nbsp; I dined scurvily to-day with
Mr. Lewis and a parson; and then went to see Lord Treasurer, and
met him coming from his house in his coach: he smiled, and I
shrugged, and we smoked each other; and so my visit is
paid.&nbsp; I now confine myself to see him only twice a week: he
has invited me to Windsor, and betwixt two stools, etc.&nbsp; I
will go live at Windsor, if possible, that&rsquo;s pozzz.&nbsp; I
have always the luck to pass my summer in London.&nbsp; I called
this evening to see poor Sir Matthew Dudley, a Commissioner of
the Customs; I know he is to be out for certain: he is in hopes
of continuing: I would not tell him bad news, but advised him to
prepare for the worst.&nbsp; Dilly was with me this morning, to
invite me to dine at Kensington on Sunday with Lord Mountjoy, who
goes soon for Ireland.&nbsp; Your late Chief-Justice Broderick <a
name="citation253a"></a><a href="#footnote253a"
class="citation">[253a]</a> is here, and they say violent as a
tiger.&nbsp; How is party among you at Wexford?&nbsp; Are the
majority of ladies for the late or present Ministry?&nbsp; Write
me Wexford news, and love Presto, because he is a good boy.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; Although it was shaving-day, I walked to Chelsea,
and was there by nine this morning; and the Dean of Carlisle and
I crossed the water to Battersea, and went in his chariot to
Greenwich, where we dined at Dr. Gastrell&rsquo;s, and passed the
afternoon at Lewisham, at the Dean of Canterbury&rsquo;s; <a
name="citation253b"></a><a href="#footnote253b"
class="citation">[253b]</a> and there I saw Moll Stanhope, <a
name="citation253c"></a><a href="#footnote253c"
class="citation">[253c]</a> who is grown monstrously tall, but
not so handsome as formerly.&nbsp; It is the first little
rambling journey I have had this summer about London, and they
are the agreeablest pastimes one can have, in a friend&rsquo;s
coach, and to good company.&nbsp; Bank Stock is fallen three or
four per cent. by the whispers about the town of the
Queen&rsquo;s being ill, who is however very well.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; How many books have you carried with you to <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>Wexford?&nbsp; What, not one single book?&nbsp; Oh, but
your time will be so taken up; and you can borrow of the
parson.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Sir Andrew Fountaine and Dilly
at Kensington with Lord Mountjoy; and in the afternoon Stratford
came there, and told me my two hundred pounds were paid at last;
so that business is over, and I am at ease about it; and I wish
all your money was in the Bank too.&nbsp; I will have my other
hundred pounds there, that is in Hawkshaw&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;
Have you had the interest of it paid yet?&nbsp; I ordered
Parvisol to do it.&nbsp; What makes Presto write so
crooked?&nbsp; I will answer your letter to-morrow, and send it
on Tuesday.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s hot weather come again, yesterday
and to-day: fine drinking waters now.&nbsp; We had a sad pert
dull parson at Kensington to-day.&nbsp; I almost repent my coming
to town; I want the walks I had.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; I dined in the City to-day with a hedge <a
name="citation254"></a><a href="#footnote254"
class="citation">[254]</a> acquaintance, and the day passed
without any consequence.&nbsp; I will answer your letter
to-morrow.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I have put your letter before me, and
am going to answer it.&nbsp; Hold your tongue: stand by.&nbsp;
Your weather and ours were not alike; we had not a bit of hot
weather in June, yet you complain of it on the 19th day.&nbsp;
What, you used to love hot weather then?&nbsp; I could never
endure it: I detest and abominate it.&nbsp; I would not live in a
hot country, to be king of it.&nbsp; What a splutter you keep
about my bonds with Raymond, and all to affront Presto!&nbsp;
Presto will be suspicious of everything but MD, in spite of your
little nose.&nbsp; Soft and fair, Madam Stella, how you gallop
away, in your spleen and your rage, about repenting my journey,
and preferment here, and sixpence a dozen, and nasty England, and
Laracor all my life.&nbsp; Hey-dazy, will you never have
done?&nbsp; I had no offers of any living.&nbsp; Lord Keeper told
me some months ago he would give me one when I pleased; but I
told him I would not take any from him; and the Secretary told me
t&rsquo;other day he had <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>refused a very good one for me, but
it was in a place he did not like; and I know nothing of getting
anything here, and, if they would give me leave, I would come
over just now.&nbsp; Addison, I hear, has changed his mind about
going over; but I have not seen him these four months.&mdash;Oh
ay, that&rsquo;s true, Dingley; that&rsquo;s like herself:
millions of businesses to do before she goes.&nbsp; Yes, my head
has been pretty well, but threatening within these two or three
days, which I impute to some fruit I ate; but I will eat no more:
not a bit of any sort.&nbsp; I suppose you had a journey without
dust, and that was happy.&nbsp; I long for a Wexford letter, but
must not think of it yet: your last was finished but three weeks
ago.&nbsp; It is d&mdash;d news you tell me of Mrs. F&mdash;; it
makes me love England less a great deal.&nbsp; I know nothing of
the trunk being left or taken; so &rsquo;tis odd enough, if the
things in it were mine; and I think I was told that there are
some things for me that my mother left particularly to me.&nbsp;
I am really sorry for &mdash;; that scoundrel &mdash; will have
his estate after his mother&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Let me know if
Mrs. Walls has got her tea: I hope Richardson <a
name="citation255a"></a><a href="#footnote255a"
class="citation">[255a]</a> stayed in Dublin till it came.&nbsp;
Mrs. Walls needed not have that blemish in her eye; for I am not
in love with her at all.&nbsp; No, I do not like anything in the
<i>Examiner</i> after the 45th, except the first part of the
46th; <a name="citation255b"></a><a href="#footnote255b"
class="citation">[255b]</a> all the rest is trash; and if you
like them, especially the 47th, your judgment is spoiled by ill
company and want of reading, which I am more sorry for than you
think: and I have spent fourteen years in improving you to little
purpose.&nbsp; (Mr. Tooke is come here, and I must
stop.)&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Treasurer to-day,
and he kept me till nine; so I cannot send this to-night, as I
intended, nor write some other letters.&nbsp; Green, <a
name="citation255c"></a><a href="#footnote255c"
class="citation">[255c]</a> his surgeon, was there, and dressed
his breast; that is, put on a plaster, which is still requisite:
and I took an opportunity to speak to him of the Queen; but he
cut me short with this saying, &ldquo;<i>Laissez faire &agrave;
Don Antoine</i>,&rdquo; which is a French proverb, expressing,
&ldquo;Leave that to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; I find he is <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>against her
taking much physic; and I doubt he cannot persuade her to take
Dr. Radcliffe.&nbsp; However, she is very well now, and all the
story of her illness, except the first day or two, was a
lie.&nbsp; We had some business, that company hindered us from
doing, though he is earnest for it, yet would not appoint me a
certain day, but bids me come at all times till we can have
leisure.&nbsp; This takes up a great deal of my time, and I can
do nothing I would do for them.&nbsp; I was with the Secretary
this morning, and we both think to go to Windsor for some days,
to despatch an affair, if we can have leisure.&nbsp; Sterne met
me just now in the street by his lodgings, and I went in for an
hour to Jemmy Leigh, who loves London dearly: he asked after you
with great respect and friendship.&mdash;To return to your
letter.&nbsp; Your Bishop Mills <a name="citation256a"></a><a
href="#footnote256a" class="citation">[256a]</a> hates me
mortally: I wonder he should speak well of me, having abused me
in all places where he went.&nbsp; So you pay your way.&nbsp;
Cudsho: you had a fine supper, I warrant; two pullets, and a
bottle of wine, and some currants.&mdash;It is just three weeks
to-day since you set out to Wexford; you were three days going,
and I do not expect a letter these ten days yet, or rather this
fortnight.&nbsp; I got a grant of the <i>Gazette</i> <a
name="citation256b"></a><a href="#footnote256b"
class="citation">[256b]</a> for Ben Tooke this morning from Mr.
Secretary: it will be worth to him a hundred pounds a year.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; To-day I took leave of Mrs. Barton, who is going
into the country; and I dined with Sir John Stanley, <a
name="citation256c"></a><a href="#footnote256c"
class="citation">[256c]</a> where I have not been this great
while.&nbsp; There dined with us Lord Rochester, and his fine
daughter, Lady Jane, <a name="citation256d"></a><a
href="#footnote256d" class="citation">[256d]</a> just growing a
top-toast.&nbsp; I have been endeavouring to save Sir Matthew <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>Dudley, <a
name="citation257a"></a><a href="#footnote257a"
class="citation">[257a]</a> but fear I cannot.&nbsp; I walked the
Mall six times to-night for exercise, and would have done more;
but, as empty as the town is, a fool got hold of me, and so I
came home, to tell you this shall go to-morrow, without fail, and
follow you to Wexford, like a dog.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; Dean Atterbury sent to me to dine with him at
Chelsea.&nbsp; I refused his coach, and walked, and am come back
by seven, because I would finish this letter, and some others I
am writing.&nbsp; Patrick tells me the maid says one Mr. Walls, a
clergyman, a tall man, was here to visit me.&nbsp; Is it your
Irish Archdeacon?&nbsp; I shall be sorry for it; but I shall make
shift to see him seldom enough, as I do Dilly.&nbsp; What can he
do here? or is it somebody else?&nbsp; The Duke of Newcastle <a
name="citation257b"></a><a href="#footnote257b"
class="citation">[257b]</a> is dead by the fall he had from his
horse.&nbsp; God send poor Stella her health, and keep MD
happy!&nbsp; Farewell, and love Presto, who loves MD above all
things ten million of times.&nbsp; God bless the dear Wexford
girls.&nbsp; Farewell again, etc. etc.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXVII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>July</i> 19, 1711.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> just sent my 26th, and have
nothing to say, because I have other letters to write (pshaw, I
began too high); but I must lay the beginning like a nest-egg:
to-morrow I will say more, and fetch up this line to be
straight.&nbsp; This is enough at present for two dear saucy
naughty girls.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; Have I told you that Walls has been with me, and
leaves the town in three days?&nbsp; He has brought no gown with
him.&nbsp; Dilly carried him to a play.&nbsp; He has come upon a
foolish errand, and goes back as he comes.&nbsp; I was this day
<a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>with
Lord Peterborow, who is going another ramble: I believe I told
you so.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Treasurer, but cannot get him to
do his own business with me; he has put me off till
to-morrow.</p>
<p>21, 22.&nbsp; I dined yesterday with Lord Treasurer, who would
needs take me along with him to Windsor, although I refused him
several times, having no linen, etc.&nbsp; I had just time to
desire Lord Forbes <a name="citation258a"></a><a
href="#footnote258a" class="citation">[258a]</a> to call at my
lodging and order my man to send my things to-day to Windsor by
his servant.&nbsp; I lay last night at the Secretary&rsquo;s
lodgings at Windsor, and borrowed one of his shirts to go to
Court in.&nbsp; The Queen is very well.&nbsp; I dined with Mr.
Masham; and not hearing anything of my things, I got Lord
Winchelsea to bring me to town.&nbsp; Here I found that Patrick
had broke open the closet to get my linen and nightgown, and sent
them to Windsor, and there they are; and he, not thinking I would
return so soon, is gone upon his rambles: so here I am left
destitute, and forced to borrow a nightgown of my landlady, and
have not a rag to put on to-morrow: faith, it gives me the
spleen.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; It is a terrible rainy day, and
rained prodigiously on Saturday night.&nbsp; Patrick lay out last
night, and is not yet returned: faith, poor Presto is a desolate
creature; neither servant, nor linen, nor
anything.&mdash;Night.&nbsp; Lord Forbes&rsquo;s man has brought
back my portmantua, and Patrick is come; so I am in Christian
circumstances: I shall hardly commit such a frolic again.&nbsp; I
just crept out to Mrs. Van&rsquo;s, and dined, and stayed there
the afternoon: it has rained all this day.&nbsp; Windsor is a
delicious place: I never saw it before, except for an hour about
seventeen years ago.&nbsp; Walls has been here in my absence, I
suppose, to take his leave; for he designed not to stay above
five days in London.&nbsp; He says he and his wife will come here
for some months next year; and, in short, he dares not stay now
for fear of her.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; I dined to-day with a hedge <a
name="citation258b"></a><a href="#footnote258b"
class="citation">[258b]</a> friend in the City; and <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>Walls
overtook me in the street, and told me he was just getting on
horseback for Chester.&nbsp; He has as much curiosity as a cow:
he lodged with his horse in Aldersgate Street: he has bought his
wife a silk gown, and himself a hat.&nbsp; And what are you
doing? what is poor MD doing now? how do you pass your time at
Wexford? how do the waters agree with you?&nbsp; Let Presto know
soon; for Presto longs to know, and must know.&nbsp; Is not Madam
Proby curious company?&nbsp; I am afraid this rainy weather will
spoil your waters.&nbsp; We have had a great deal of wet these
three days.&nbsp; Tell me all the particulars of Wexford: the
place, the company, the diversions, the victuals, the wants, the
vexations.&nbsp; Poor Dingley never saw such a place in her life;
sent all over the town for a little parsley to a boiled chicken,
and it was not to be had; the butter is stark naught, except an
old English woman&rsquo;s; and it is such a favour to get a pound
from her now and then!&nbsp; I am glad you carried down your
sheets with you, else you must have lain in sackcloth.&nbsp; O
Lord!</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; I was this forenoon with Mr. Secretary at his
office, and helped to hinder a man of his pardon, who is
condemned for a rape.&nbsp; The Under Secretary was willing to
save him, upon an old notion that a woman cannot be ravished; but
I told the Secretary he could not pardon him without a favourable
report from the judge; besides, he was a fiddler, and
consequently a rogue, and deserved hanging for some thing else;
and so he shall swing.&nbsp; What, I must stand up for the honour
of the fair sex!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true the fellow had lain with
her a hundred times before, but what care I for that!&nbsp; What,
must a woman be ravished because she is a whore?&mdash;The
Secretary and I go on Saturday to Windsor for a week.&nbsp; I
dined with Lord Treasurer, and stayed with him till past
ten.&nbsp; I was to-day at his levee, where I went against my
custom, because I had a mind to do a good office for a gentleman:
so I talked with him before my lord, that he might see me, and
then found occasion to recommend him this afternoon.&nbsp; I was
forced to excuse my coming to the levee, <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>that I did
it to see the sight; for he was going to chide me away: I had
never been there but once, and that was long before he was
Treasurer.&nbsp; The rooms were all full, and as many Whigs as
Tories.&nbsp; He whispered me a jest or two, and bid me come to
dinner.&nbsp; I left him but just now; and &rsquo;tis late.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; Mr. Addison and I have at last met again.&nbsp; I
dined with him and Steele to-day at young Jacob
Tonson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The two Jacobs <a
name="citation260a"></a><a href="#footnote260a"
class="citation">[260a]</a> think it is I who have made the
Secretary take from them the printing of the <i>Gazette</i>,
which they are going to lose, and Ben Tooke and another <a
name="citation260b"></a><a href="#footnote260b"
class="citation">[260b]</a> are to have it.&nbsp; Jacob came to
me the other day, to make his court; but I told him it was too
late, and that it was not my doing.&nbsp; I reckon they will lose
it in a week or two.&nbsp; Mr. Addison and I talked as usual, and
as if we had seen one another yesterday; and Steele and I were
very easy, though I writ him lately a biting letter, in answer to
one of his, where he desired me to recommend a friend of his to
Lord Treasurer.&nbsp; Go, get you gone to your waters,
sirrah.&nbsp; Do they give you a stomach?&nbsp; Do you eat
heartily?&mdash;We have had much rain to-day and yesterday.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; I dined to-day in the City, and saw poor Patty Rolt,
and gave her a pistole to help her a little forward against she
goes to board in the country.&nbsp; She has but eighteen pounds a
year to live on, and is forced to seek out for cheap
places.&nbsp; Sometimes they raise their price, and sometimes
they starve her, and then she is forced to shift.&nbsp; Patrick
the puppy put too much ink in my standish, <a
name="citation260c"></a><a href="#footnote260c"
class="citation">[260c]</a> and, carrying too many things
together, I spilled it on my paper and floor.&nbsp; The town is
dull, wet, and empty; Wexford is worth two of it; I hope so at
least, and that poor little MD finds it so.&nbsp; I reckon upon
<a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>going to
Windsor to-morrow with Mr. Secretary, unless he changes his mind,
or some other business prevents him.&nbsp; I shall stay there a
week, I hope.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary sent me word he will
call at my lodgings by two this afternoon, to take me to Windsor;
so I must dine nowhere; and I promised Lord Treasurer to dine
with him to-day; but I suppose we shall dine at Windsor at five,
for we make but three hours there. <a name="citation261a"></a><a
href="#footnote261a" class="citation">[261a]</a>&nbsp; I am going
abroad, but have left Patrick to put up my things, and to be sure
to be at home half an hour before two.&mdash;Windsor, at
night.&nbsp; We did not leave London till three, and dined here
between six and seven; at nine I left the company, and went to
see Lord Treasurer, who is just come.&nbsp; I chid him for coming
so late; he chid me for not dining with him; said he stayed an
hour for me.&nbsp; Then I went and sat with Mr. Lewis till just
now, and it is past eleven.&nbsp; I lie in the same house with
the Secretary, one of the Prebendary&rsquo;s houses.&nbsp; The
Secretary is not come from his apartment in the Castle.&nbsp; Do
you think that abominable dog Patrick was out after two to-day,
and I in a fright every moment, for fear the chariot should come;
and when he came in, he had not put up one rag of my
things!&nbsp; I never was in a greater passion, and would
certainly have cropped one of his ears, if I had not looked every
moment for the Secretary, who sent his equipage to my lodging
before, and came in a chair from Whitehall to me, and happened to
stay half an hour later than he intended.&nbsp; One of Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s servants gave me a letter to-night: I found it
was from &mdash;, with an offer of fifty pounds, to be paid me in
what manner I pleased; because, he said, he desired to be well
with me.&nbsp; I was in a rage; <a name="citation261b"></a><a
href="#footnote261b" class="citation">[261b]</a> but my friend
Lewis cooled me, and said it is what the best men sometimes meet
with; and I have been not seldom served in the like manner,
although not so grossly.&nbsp; In these cases I never demur a
moment, nor ever found the least inclination to take
anything.&nbsp; Well, I will go try to sleep in my new bed, and
to <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>dream
of poor Wexford MD, and Stella that drinks water, and Dingley
that drinks ale.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; I was at Court and church to-day, as I was this day
se&rsquo;ennight: I generally am acquainted with about thirty in
the drawing-room, and I am so proud I make all the lords come up
to me: one passes half an hour pleasant enough.&nbsp; We had a
dunce to preach before the Queen to-day, which often
happens.&nbsp; Windsor is a delicious situation, but the town is
scoundrel.&nbsp; I have this morning got the <i>Gazette</i> for
Ben Tooke and one Barber a printer; it will be about three
hundred pounds a year between them.&nbsp; The other fellow was
printer of the <i>Examiner</i>, which is now laid down. <a
name="citation262a"></a><a href="#footnote262a"
class="citation">[262a]</a>&nbsp; I dined with the Secretary: we
were a dozen in all, three Scotch lords, and Lord
Peterborow.&nbsp; The Duke of Hamilton <a
name="citation262b"></a><a href="#footnote262b"
class="citation">[262b]</a> would needs be witty, and hold up my
train as I walked upstairs.&nbsp; It is an ill circumstance that
on Sundays much company always meet at the great tables.&nbsp;
Lord Treasurer told at Court what I said to Mr. Secretary on this
occasion.&nbsp; The Secretary showed me his bill of fare, to
encourage me to dine with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poh,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;show me a bill of company, for I value not your
dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; See how this is all blotted, <a
name="citation262c"></a><a href="#footnote262c"
class="citation">[262c]</a> I can write no more here, but to tell
you I love MD dearly, and God bless them.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; In my conscience, I fear I shall have the
gout.&nbsp; I sometimes feel pains about my feet and toes: I
never drank till within these two years, and I did it to cure my
head.&nbsp; I often sit evenings with some of these people, and
drink in my turn; but I am now resolved to drink ten times less
than before; but they advise me to let what I drink be all wine,
and not to put water to it.&nbsp; Tooke and the printer stayed
to-day to <a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>finish their affair, and treated me and two of the
Under Secretaries upon their getting the <i>Gazette</i>.&nbsp;
Then I went to see Lord Treasurer, and chid him for not taking
notice of me at Windsor.&nbsp; He said he kept a place for me
yesterday at dinner, and expected me there; but I was glad I did
not go, because the Duke of Buckingham was there, and that would
have made us acquainted; which I have no mind to.&nbsp; However,
we appointed to sup at Mr. Masham&rsquo;s, and there stayed till
past one o&rsquo;clock; and that is late, sirrahs: and I have
much business.</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; I have sent a noble haunch of venison this afternoon
to Mrs. Vanhomrigh: I wish you had it, sirrahs.&nbsp; I dined
gravely with my landlord the Secretary.&nbsp; The Queen was
abroad to-day in order to hunt; but, finding it disposed to rain,
she kept in her coach; she hunts in a chaise with one horse,
which she drives herself, and drives furiously, like Jehu, and is
a mighty hunter, like Nimrod.&nbsp; Dingley has heard of Nimrod,
but not Stella, for it is in the Bible.&nbsp; I was to-day at
Eton, which is but just cross the bridge, to see my Lord
Kerry&rsquo;s son, <a name="citation263"></a><a
href="#footnote263" class="citation">[263]</a> who is at school
there.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary has given me a warrant for a buck; I
can&rsquo;t send it to MD.&nbsp; It is a sad thing, faith,
considering how Presto loves MD, and how MD would love
Presto&rsquo;s venison for Presto&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; God bless
the two dear Wexford girls!</p>
<p>Aug. 1.&nbsp; We had for dinner the fellow of that haunch of
venison I sent to London; &rsquo;twas mighty fat and good, and
eight people at dinner; that was bad.&nbsp; The Queen and I were
going to take the air this afternoon, but not together; and were
both hindered by a sudden rain.&nbsp; Her coaches and chaises all
went back, and the guards too; and I scoured into the
market-place for shelter.&nbsp; I intended to have walked up the
finest avenue I ever saw, two miles long, with two rows of elms
on each side.&nbsp; I walked in the evening a little upon the
terrace, and came home at eight: Mr. Secretary came soon after,
and we were engaging in deep discourse, and I was endeavouring to
settle some points of the greatest consequence, <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>and had
wormed myself pretty well into him, when his Under Secretary came
in (who lodges in the same house with us) and interrupted all my
scheme.&nbsp; I have just left him: it is late, etc.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I have been now five days at Windsor, and Patrick has
been drunk three times that I have seen, and oftener I
believe.&nbsp; He has lately had clothes that have cost me five
pounds, and the dog thinks he has the whip-hand of me: he begins
to master me; so now I am resolved to part with him, and will use
him without the least pity.&nbsp; The Secretary and I have been
walking three or four hours to-day.&nbsp; The Duchess of
Shrewsbury <a name="citation264a"></a><a href="#footnote264a"
class="citation">[264a]</a> asked him, was not that
Dr.&mdash;Dr.&mdash; and she could not say my name in English,
but said Dr. Presto, which is Italian for Swift.&nbsp; Whimsical
enough, as Billy Swift <a name="citation264b"></a><a
href="#footnote264b" class="citation">[264b]</a> says.&nbsp; I go
to-morrow with the Secretary to his house at Bucklebury,
twenty-five miles from hence, and return early on Sunday
morning.&nbsp; I will leave this letter behind me locked up, and
give you an account of my journey when I return.&nbsp; I had a
letter yesterday from the Bishop of Clogher, who is coming up to
his Parliament.&nbsp; Have you any correspondence with him to
Wexford?&nbsp; Methinks, I now long for a letter from you, dated
Wexford, July 24, etc.&nbsp; O Lord, that would be so pretending;
<a name="citation264c"></a><a href="#footnote264c"
class="citation">[264c]</a> and then, says you, Stella
can&rsquo;t write much, because it is bad to write when one
drinks the waters; and I think, says you, I find myself better
already, but I cannot tell yet whether it be the journey or the
waters.&nbsp; Presto is so silly to-night; yes he be; but Presto
loves MD dearly, as hope saved.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I am to go this day at noon, as I told
you, to Bucklebury: we dine at twelve, and expect to be there in
<a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>four
hours.&nbsp; I cannot bid you good-night now, because I shall be
twenty-five miles from this paper to-night, and so my journal
must have a break; so good-morrow, etc.</p>
<p>4, 5.&nbsp; I dined yesterday at Bucklebury, where we lay two
nights, and set out this morning at eight, and were here at
twelve; in four hours we went twenty-six miles.&nbsp; Mr.
Secretary was a perfect country gentleman at Bucklebury: he
smoked tobacco with one or two neighbours; he inquired after the
wheat in such a field; he went to visit his hounds, and knew all
their names; he and his lady saw me to my chamber just in the
country fashion.&nbsp; His house is in the midst of near three
thousand pounds a year he had by his lady, <a
name="citation265"></a><a href="#footnote265"
class="citation">[265]</a> who is descended from Jack Newbury, of
whom books and ballads are written; and there is an old picture
of him in the house.&nbsp; She is a great favourite of
mine.&nbsp; I lost church to-day; but I dressed and shaved, and
went to Court, and would not dine with the Secretary, but engaged
myself to a private dinner with Mr. Lewis, and one friend
more.&nbsp; We go to London to-morrow; for Lord Dartmouth, the
other Secretary, is come, and they are here their weeks by
turns.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer comes every Saturday to Windsor, and
goes away on Monday or Tuesday.&nbsp; I was with him this morning
at his levee, for one cannot see him otherwise here, he is so
hurried: we had some talk; and I told him I would stay this week
at Windsor by myself, where I can have more leisure to do some
business that concerns them.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer and the
Secretary thought to mortify me; for they told me they had been
talking a great deal of me to-day to the Queen, and she said she
had never heard of me.&nbsp; I told them that was their fault,
and not hers, etc., and so we laughed.&nbsp; I dined with the
Secretary, and let him go to London at five without me; and here
am I alone in the Prebendary&rsquo;s house, which Mr. Secretary
has taken; only Mr. Lewis is in my neighbourhood, and we shall be
good company.&nbsp; <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>The Vice-Chamberlain, <a
name="citation266a"></a><a href="#footnote266a"
class="citation">[266a]</a> and Mr. Masham, and the Green Cloth,
<a name="citation266b"></a><a href="#footnote266b"
class="citation">[266b]</a> have promised me dinners.&nbsp; I
shall want but four till Mr. Secretary returns.&nbsp; We have a
music-meeting in our town to-night.&nbsp; I went to the rehearsal
of it, and there was Margarita, <a name="citation266c"></a><a
href="#footnote266c" class="citation">[266c]</a> and her sister,
and another drab, and a parcel of fiddlers: I was weary, and
would not go to the meeting, which I am sorry for, because I
heard it was a great assembly.&nbsp; Mr. Lewis came from it, and
sat with me till just now; and &rsquo;tis late.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; I can do no business, I fear, because Mr. Lewis, who
has nothing or little to do here, sticks close to me.&nbsp; I
dined to-day with the gentlemen ushers, among scurvy company; but
the Queen was hunting the stag till four this afternoon, and she
drove in her chaise above forty miles, and it was five before we
went to dinner.&nbsp; Here are fine walks about this town.&nbsp;
I sometimes walk up the avenue.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; There was a Drawing-room to-day at Court; but so few
company, that the Queen sent for us into her bed-chamber, where
we made our bows, and stood about twenty of us round the room,
while she looked at us round with her fan in her mouth, and once
a minute said about three words to some that were nearest her,
and then she was told dinner was ready, and went out.&nbsp; I
dined at the Green Cloth, by Mr. Scarborow&rsquo;s <a
name="citation266d"></a><a href="#footnote266d"
class="citation">[266d]</a> invitation, who is in waiting.&nbsp;
It is much the best table in England, and costs the Queen a
thousand pounds a month while she is at Windsor or Hampton Court,
and is the only mark of magnificence or hospitality I can see in
the <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>Queen&rsquo;s family: it is designed to entertain
foreign Ministers, and people of quality, who come to see the
Queen, and have no place to dine at.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Mr. Coke, the Vice-Chamberlain, made me a long visit
this morning, and invited me to dinner; but the toast, his lady,
<a name="citation267a"></a><a href="#footnote267a"
class="citation">[267a]</a> was unfortunately engaged to Lady
Sunderland. <a name="citation267b"></a><a href="#footnote267b"
class="citation">[267b]</a>&nbsp; Lord Treasurer stole here last
night, but did not lie at his lodgings in the Castle; and, after
seeing the Queen, went back again.&nbsp; I just drank a dish of
chocolate with him.&nbsp; I fancy I shall have reason to be angry
with him very soon; but what care I?&nbsp; I believe I shall die
with Ministries in my debt.&mdash;This night I received a certain
letter from a place called Wexford, from two dear naughty girls
of my acquaintance; but, faith, I will not answer it here, no in
troth.&nbsp; I will send this to Mr. Reading, supposing it will
find you returned; and I hope better for the waters.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Mr. Vice-Chamberlain lent me his horses to ride
about and see the country this morning.&nbsp; Dr. Arbuthnot, the
Queen&rsquo;s physician and favourite, went out with me to show
me the places: we went a little after the Queen, and overtook
Miss Forester, <a name="citation267c"></a><a href="#footnote267c"
class="citation">[267c]</a> a maid of honour, on her palfrey,
taking the air; we made her go along with us.&nbsp; We saw a
place they have made for a famous horse-race to-morrow, where the
Queen will come.&nbsp; We met the Queen coming back, and Miss
Forester stood, like us, with her hat off while the Queen went
by.&nbsp; The Doctor and I left the lady where we found her, but
under other conductors; and we dined at a little <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>place he
has taken, about a mile off.&mdash;When I came back I found Mr.
Scarborow had sent all about to invite me to the Green Cloth, and
lessened his company on purpose to make me easy.&nbsp; It is very
obliging, and will cost me thanks.&nbsp; Much company is come to
town this evening, to see to-morrow&rsquo;s race.&nbsp; I was
tired with riding a trotting mettlesome horse a dozen miles,
having not been on horseback this twelvemonth.&nbsp; And Miss
Forester did not make it easier; she is a silly true maid of
honour, and I did not like her, although she be a toast, and was
dressed like a man. <a name="citation268a"></a><a
href="#footnote268a" class="citation">[268a]</a></p>
<p>11.&nbsp; I will send this letter to-day.&nbsp; I expect the
Secretary by noon.&nbsp; I will not go to the race unless I can
get room in some coach.&nbsp; It is now morning.&nbsp; I must
rise, and fold up and seal my letter.&nbsp; Farewell, and God
preserve dearest MD.</p>
<p>I believe I shall leave this town on Monday.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXVIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Windsor</span>,
<i>Aug.</i> 11, 1711.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">sent</span> away my twenty-seventh this
morning in an express to London, and directed to Mr. Reading:
this shall go to your lodgings, where I reckon you will be
returned before it reaches you.&nbsp; I intended to go to the
race <a name="citation268b"></a><a href="#footnote268b"
class="citation">[268b]</a> to-day, but was hindered by a visit:
I believe I told you so in my last.&nbsp; I dined to-day at the
Green Cloth, where everybody had been at the race but myself, and
we were twenty in all, and very noisy company; but I made the
Vice-Chamberlain and two friends more sit at a side table, to be
a little quiet.&nbsp; At six I went to see the Secretary, who is
returned; but Lord Keeper sent to desire I would sup with him,
where I stayed till just <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>now: Lord Treasurer and Secretary
were to come to us, but both failed.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis late,
etc.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; I was this morning to visit Lord Keeper, who made me
reproaches that I had never visited him at Windsor.&nbsp; He had
a present sent him of delicious peaches, and he was champing and
champing, but I durst not eat one; I wished Dingley had some of
them, for poor Stella can no more eat fruit than Presto.&nbsp;
Dilly Ashe is come to Windsor; and after church I carried him up
to the drawing-room, and talked to the Keeper and Treasurer, on
purpose to show them to him; and he saw the Queen and several
great lords, and the Duchess of Montagu; <a
name="citation269a"></a><a href="#footnote269a"
class="citation">[269a]</a> he was mighty happy, and resolves to
fill a letter to the Bishop. <a name="citation269b"></a><a
href="#footnote269b" class="citation">[269b]</a>&nbsp; My friend
Lewis and I dined soberly with Dr. Adams, <a
name="citation269c"></a><a href="#footnote269c"
class="citation">[269c]</a> the only neighbour prebendary.&nbsp;
One of the prebendaries here is lately a peer, by the death of
his father.&nbsp; He is now Lord Willoughby of Broke, <a
name="citation269d"></a><a href="#footnote269d"
class="citation">[269d]</a> and will sit in the House of Lords
with his gown.&nbsp; I supped to-night at Masham&rsquo;s with
Lord Treasurer, Mr. Secretary, and Prior.&nbsp; The Treasurer
made us stay till twelve, before he came from the Queen, and
&rsquo;tis now past two.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; I reckoned upon going to London to-day; but by an
accident the Cabinet Council did not sit last night, and sat
to-day, so we go to-morrow at six in the morning.&nbsp; I missed
the race to-day by coming out too late, when everybody&rsquo;s
coach was gone, and ride I would not: I felt my last riding three
days after.&nbsp; We had a dinner to-day at the Secretary&rsquo;s
lodgings without him: Mr. Hare, <a name="citation269e"></a><a
href="#footnote269e" class="citation">[269e]</a> his Under
Secretary, Mr. Lewis, Brigadier Sutton, <a
name="citation269f"></a><a href="#footnote269f"
class="citation">[269f]</a> and I, dined together; and I made <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>the
Vice-Chamberlain take a snap with us, rather than stay till five
for his lady, who was gone to the race.&nbsp; The reason why the
Cabinet Council was not held last night was because Mr. Secretary
St. John would not sit with your Duke of Somerset. <a
name="citation270a"></a><a href="#footnote270a"
class="citation">[270a]</a>&nbsp; So to-day the Duke was forced
to go to the race while the Cabinet was held.&nbsp; We have
music-meetings in our town, and I was at the rehearsal
t&rsquo;other day; but I did not value it, nor would go to the
meeting.&nbsp; Did I tell you this before?</p>
<p>London, 14.&nbsp; We came to town this day in two hours and
forty minutes: twenty miles are nothing here.&nbsp; I found a
letter from the Archbishop of Dublin, sent me the Lord knows
how.&nbsp; He says some of the bishops will hardly believe that
Lord Treasurer got the Queen to remit the First-Fruits before the
Duke of Ormond was declared Lord Lieutenant, and that the bishops
have written a letter to Lord Treasurer to thank him.&nbsp; He
has sent me the address of the Convocation, ascribing, in good
part, that affair to the Duke, who had less share in it than MD;
for if it had not been for MD, I should not have been so good a
solicitor.&nbsp; I dined to-day in the City, about a little bit
of mischief, with a printer.&mdash;I found Mrs. Vanhomrigh all in
combustion, squabbling with her rogue of a landlord; she has left
her house, and gone out of our neighbourhood a good way.&nbsp;
Her eldest daughter is come of age, and going to Ireland to look
after her fortune, and get it in her own hands. <a
name="citation270b"></a><a href="#footnote270b"
class="citation">[270b]</a></p>
<p>15.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Mrs. Van, who goes to-night to
her new lodgings.&nbsp; I went at six to see Lord Treasurer; but
his company was gone, contrary to custom, and he was busy, <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>and I was
forced to stay some time before I could see him.&nbsp; We were
together hardly an hour, and he went away, being in haste.&nbsp;
He desired me to dine with him on Friday, because there would be
a friend of his that I must see: my Lord Harley told me, when he
was gone, that it was Mrs. Masham his father meant, who is come
to town to lie-in, and whom I never saw, though her husband is
one of our Society.&nbsp; God send her a good time! her death
would be a terrible thing. <a name="citation271a"></a><a
href="#footnote271a" class="citation">[271a]</a>&mdash;Do you
know that I have ventured all my credit with these great
Ministers, to clear some misunderstandings betwixt them; and if
there be no breach, I ought to have the merit of it.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a plaguy ticklish piece of work, and a man hazards
losing both sides.&nbsp; It is a pity the world does not know my
virtue.&mdash;I thought the clergy in Convocation in Ireland
would have given me thanks for being their solicitor; but I hear
of no such thing.&nbsp; Pray talk occasionally on that subject,
and let me know what you hear.&nbsp; Do you know the greatness of
my spirit, that I value their thanks not a rush, but at my return
shall freely let all people know that it was my Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s action, wherein the Duke of Ormond had no more
share than a cat?&nbsp; And so they may go whistle, and
I&rsquo;ll go sleep.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; I was this day in the City, and dined at
Pontack&rsquo;s <a name="citation271b"></a><a
href="#footnote271b" class="citation">[271b]</a> with Stratford,
and two other merchants.&nbsp; Pontack told us, although his wine
was so good, he sold it cheaper than others; he took but seven
shillings a flask.&nbsp; Are not these pretty rates?&nbsp; The
books he sent for from Hamburg are come, but not yet got out of
the custom-house.&nbsp; My library will be at least double when I
come back.&nbsp; I shall go to Windsor again on Saturday, to meet
our Society, who are <a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>to sup at Mr. Secretary&rsquo;s; but
I believe I shall return on Monday, and then I will answer your
letter, that lies here safe underneath;&mdash;I see it; lie
still: I will answer you when the ducks have eaten up the
dirt.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s with Mrs.
Masham, and she is extremely like one Mrs. Malolly, that was once
my landlady in Trim.&nbsp; She was used with mighty kindness and
respect, like a favourite.&nbsp; It signifies nothing going to
this Lord Treasurer about business, although it be his own.&nbsp;
He was in haste, and desires I will come again, and dine with him
to-morrow.&nbsp; His famous lying porter is fallen sick, and they
think he will die: I wish I had all my half-crowns again.&nbsp; I
believe I have told you he is an old Scotch fanatic, and the
damn&rsquo;dest liar in his office alive. <a
name="citation272a"></a><a href="#footnote272a"
class="citation">[272a]</a>&nbsp; I have a mind to recommend
Patrick to succeed him: I have trained him up pretty well.&nbsp;
I reckon for certain you are now in town.&nbsp; The weather now
begins to alter to rain.</p>
<p>Windsor, 18.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord Treasurer, and he
would make me go with him to Windsor, although I was engaged to
the Secretary, to whom I made my excuses: we had in the coach
besides, his son and son-in-law, Lord Harley and Lord Dupplin,
who are two of our Society, and seven of us met by appointment,
and supped this night with the Secretary.&nbsp; It was past nine
before we got here, but a fine moonshiny night.&nbsp; I shall go
back, I believe, on Monday.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very late.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; The Queen did not stir out to-day, she is in a
little fit of the gout.&nbsp; I dined at Mr. Masham&rsquo;s; we
had none but our Society members, six in all, and I supped with
Lord Treasurer.&nbsp; The Queen has ordered twenty thousand
pounds to go on with the building at Blenheim, which has been
starved till now, since the change of the Ministry. <a
name="citation272b"></a><a href="#footnote272b"
class="citation">[272b]</a>&nbsp; I <a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>suppose it is to reward his last
action of getting into the French lines. <a
name="citation273a"></a><a href="#footnote273a"
class="citation">[273a]</a>&nbsp; Lord Treasurer kept me till
past twelve.</p>
<p>London, 20.&nbsp; It rained terribly every step of our journey
to-day: I returned with the Secretary after a dinner of cold
meat, and went to Mrs. Van&rsquo;s, where I sat the
evening.&nbsp; I grow very idle, because I have a great deal of
business.&nbsp; Tell me how you passed your time at Wexford; and
are not you glad at heart you have got home safe to your lodgings
at St. Mary&rsquo;s, pray?&nbsp; And so your friends come to
visit you; and Mrs. Walls is much better of her eye; and the Dean
is just as he used to be: and what does Walls say of London?
&rsquo;tis a reasoning coxcomb.&nbsp; And Goody Stoyte, and
Hannah what d&rsquo;ye call her; no, her name an&rsquo;t Hannah,
Catherine I mean; they were so glad to see the ladies again! and
Mrs. Manley wanted a companion at ombre.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; I writ to-day to the Archbishop of Dublin, and
enclosed a long politic paper by itself.&nbsp; You know the
bishops are all angry (smoke the wax-candle drop at the bottom of
this paper) I have let the world know the First-Fruits were got
by Lord Treasurer before the Duke of Ormond was Governor.&nbsp; I
told Lord Treasurer all this, and he is very angry; but I
pacified him again by telling him they were fools, and knew
nothing of what passed here; but thought all was well enough if
they complimented the Duke of Ormond.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer gave
me t&rsquo;other day a letter of thanks he received from the
bishops of Ireland, signed by seventeen; and says he will write
them an answer.&nbsp; The Dean of Carlisle sat with me to-day
till three; and I went to dine with Lord Treasurer, who dined
abroad, so did the Secretary, and I was left in the suds.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas almost four, and I got to Sir Matthew Dudley, who had
half dined.&nbsp; Thornhill, who killed Sir Cholmley Dering, <a
name="citation273b"></a><a href="#footnote273b"
class="citation">[273b]</a> was murdered by two men, on Turnham
Green, last Monday night: as they stabbed him, <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>they bid
him remember Sir Cholmley Dering.&nbsp; They had quarrelled at
Hampton Court, and followed and stabbed him on horseback.&nbsp;
We have only a Grub Street paper of it, but I believe it is
true.&nbsp; I went myself through Turnham Green the same night,
which was yesterday.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; We have had terrible rains these two or three
days.&nbsp; I intended to dine at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s, but
went to see Lady Abercorn, who is come to town, and my lord; and
I dined with them, and visited Lord Treasurer this evening.&nbsp;
His porter is mending.&nbsp; I sat with my lord about three
hours, and am come home early to be busy.&nbsp; Passing by
White&rsquo;s Chocolate-house, <a name="citation274a"></a><a
href="#footnote274a" class="citation">[274a]</a> my brother
Masham called me, and told me his wife was brought to bed of a
boy, and both very well.&nbsp; (Our Society, you must know, are
all brothers.)&nbsp; Dr. Garth told us that Mr. Henley <a
name="citation274b"></a><a href="#footnote274b"
class="citation">[274b]</a> is dead of an apoplexy.&nbsp; His
brother-in-law, Earl Poulett, is gone down to the Grange, to take
care of his funeral.&nbsp; The Earl of Danby, <a
name="citation274c"></a><a href="#footnote274c"
class="citation">[274c]</a> the Duke of Leeds&rsquo;s eldest
grandson, a very hopeful young man of about twenty, is dead at
Utrecht of the smallpox.&mdash;I long to know whether you begin
to have any good effect by your waters.&mdash;Methinks this
letter goes on slowly; &rsquo;twill be a fortnight next Saturday
since it was begun, and one side not filled.&nbsp; O fie for
shame, Presto!&nbsp; Faith, I&rsquo;m so tosticated to and from
Windsor, that I know not what to say; but, faith, I&rsquo;ll go
to Windsor again on Saturday, if they ask me, not else.&nbsp; So
lose your money again, now you are come home; do, sirrah.</p>
<p>Take your magnifying-glass, Madam Dingley.</p>
<p>You shan&rsquo;t read this, sirrah Stella; don&rsquo;t read it
for your life, for fear of your dearest eyes.</p>
<p><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>There&rsquo;s enough for this side; these Ministers
hinder me.</p>
<p>Pretty, dear, little, naughty, saucy MD.</p>
<p>Silly, impudent, loggerhead Presto.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; Dilly and I dined to-day with Lord Abercorn, and had
a fine fat haunch of venison, that smelt rarely on one side: and
after dinner Dilly won half a crown of me at backgammon at his
lodgings, to his great content.&nbsp; It is a scurvy empty town
this melancholy season of the year; but I think our weather
begins to mend.&nbsp; The roads are as deep as in winter.&nbsp;
The grapes are sad things; but the peaches are pretty good, and
there are some figs.&nbsp; I sometimes venture to eat one, but
always repent it.&nbsp; You say nothing of the box sent half a
year ago.&nbsp; I wish you would pay me for Mrs. Walls&rsquo;s
tea.&nbsp; Your mother is in the country, I suppose.&nbsp; Pray
send me the account of MD, Madam Dingley, as it stands since
November, <a name="citation275a"></a><a href="#footnote275a"
class="citation">[275a]</a> that is to say, for this year
(excluding the twenty pounds lent Stella for Wexford), for I
cannot look in your letters.&nbsp; I think I ordered that
Hawkshaw&rsquo;s interest should be paid to you.&nbsp; When you
think proper, I will let Parvisol know you have paid that twenty
pounds, or part of it; and so go play with the Dean, and I will
answer your letter to-morrow.&nbsp; Good-night, sirrahs, and love
Presto, and be good girls.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord Treasurer, who chid me for
not dining with him yesterday, for it seems I did not understand
his invitation; and their Club of the Ministry dined together,
and expected me.&nbsp; Lord Radnor <a name="citation275b"></a><a
href="#footnote275b" class="citation">[275b]</a> and I were
walking the Mall this evening; and Mr. Secretary met us, and took
a turn or two, and then stole away, and we both believed it was
to pick up some wench; and to-morrow he will be at the Cabinet
with the Queen: so goes the world!&nbsp; Prior has been out of
town these two months, nobody knows where, and is lately
returned.&nbsp; People confidently affirm he has been in France,
and I half believe it.&nbsp; It is said he was sent by the
Ministry, and for some overtures towards a peace.&nbsp; The
Secretary pretends he knows nothing of it.&nbsp; I believe <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>your
Parliament will be dissolved.&nbsp; I have been talking about the
quarrel between your Lords and Commons with Lord Treasurer, and
did, at the request of some people, desire that the Queen&rsquo;s
answer to the Commons&rsquo; address might express a dislike of
some principles, etc.; but was answered dubiously.&mdash;And so
now to your letter, fair ladies.&nbsp; I know drinking is bad; I
mean writing is bad in drinking the waters; and was angry to see
so much in Stella&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; But why Dingley drinks
them, I cannot imagine; but truly she&rsquo;ll drink waters as
well as Stella: why not?&nbsp; I hope you now find the benefit of
them since you are returned; pray let me know particularly.&nbsp;
I am glad you are forced upon exercise, which, I believe, is as
good as the waters for the heart of them.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis now
past the middle of August; so by your reckoning you are in
Dublin.&nbsp; It would vex me to the dogs that letters should
miscarry between Dublin and Wexford, after &rsquo;scaping the
salt seas.&nbsp; I will write no more to that nasty town in haste
again, I warrant you.&nbsp; I have been four Sundays together at
Windsor, of which a fortnight together; but I believe I shall not
go to-morrow, for I will not, unless the Secretary asks me.&nbsp;
I know all your news about the Mayor: it makes no noise here at
all, but the quarrel of your Parliament does; it is so very
extraordinary, and the language of the Commons so very
pretty.&nbsp; The <i>Examiner</i> has been down this month, and
was very silly the five or six last papers; but there is a
pamphlet come out, in answer to a letter to the seven Lords who
examined Gregg. <a name="citation276a"></a><a
href="#footnote276a" class="citation">[276a]</a>&nbsp; The Answer
<a name="citation276b"></a><a href="#footnote276b"
class="citation">[276b]</a> is by the real author of the
<i>Examiner</i>, as I believe; for it is very well written.&nbsp;
We had Trapp&rsquo;s poem on the Duke of Ormond <a
name="citation276c"></a><a href="#footnote276c"
class="citation">[276c]</a> printed here, and the printer <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>sold just
eleven of them.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a dull piece, not half so good
as Stella&rsquo;s; and she is very modest to compare herself with
such a poetaster.&nbsp; I am heartily sorry for poor Mrs.
Parnell&rsquo;s <a name="citation277a"></a><a
href="#footnote277a" class="citation">[277a]</a> death; she
seemed to be an excellent good-natured young woman, and I believe
the poor lad is much afflicted; they appeared to live perfectly
well together.&nbsp; Dilly is not tired at all with England, but
intends to continue here a good while: he is mighty easy to be at
distance from his two sisters-in-law.&nbsp; He finds some sort of
scrub acquaintance; goes now and then in disguise to a play;
smokes his pipe; reads now and then a little trash, and what else
the Lord knows.&nbsp; I see him now and then; for he calls here,
and the town being thin, I am less pestered with company than
usual.&nbsp; I have got rid of many of my solicitors, by doing
nothing for them: I have not above eight or nine left, and
I&rsquo;ll be as kind to them.&nbsp; Did I tell you of a knight
who desired me to speak to Lord Treasurer to give him two
thousand pounds, or five hundred pounds a year, until he could
get something better?&nbsp; I honestly delivered my message to
the Treasurer, adding, the knight was a puppy, whom I would not
give a groat to save from the gallows.&nbsp; Cole Reading&rsquo;s
father-in-law has been two or three times at me, to recommend his
lights to the Ministry, assuring me that a word of mine would,
etc.&nbsp; Did not that dog use to speak ill of me, and profess
to hate me?&nbsp; He knows not where I lodge, for I told him I
lived in the country; and I have ordered Patrick to deny me
constantly to him.&mdash;Did the Bishop of London <a
name="citation277b"></a><a href="#footnote277b"
class="citation">[277b]</a> die in Wexford? poor gentleman!&nbsp;
Did he drink the waters? were you at his burial? was it a great
funeral? so far from his <a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>friends!&nbsp; But he was very old:
we shall all follow.&nbsp; And yet it was a pity, if God
pleased.&nbsp; He was a good man; not very learned: I believe he
died but poor.&nbsp; Did he leave any charity legacies? who held
up his pall? was there a great sight of clergy? do they design a
tomb for him?&mdash;Are you sure it was the Bishop of London?
because there is an elderly gentleman here that we give the same
title to: or did you fancy all this in your water, as others do
strange things in their wine?&nbsp; They say these waters trouble
the head, and make people imagine what never came to pass.&nbsp;
Do you make no more of killing a Bishop? are these your Whiggish
tricks?&mdash;Yes, yes, I see you are in a fret.&nbsp; O, faith,
says you, saucy Presto, I&rsquo;ll break your head; what,
can&rsquo;t one report what one hears, without being made a jest
and a laughing-stock?&nbsp; Are these your English tricks, with a
murrain?&nbsp; And Sacheverell will be the next Bishop?&nbsp; He
would be glad of an addition of two hundred pounds a year to what
he has, and that is more than they will give him, for aught I
see.&nbsp; He hates the new Ministry mortally, and they hate him,
and pretend to despise him too.&nbsp; They will not allow him to
have been the occasion of the late change; at least some of them
will not: but my Lord Keeper owned it to me the other day.&nbsp;
No, Mr. Addison does not go to Ireland this year: he pretended he
would; but he is gone to Bath with Pastoral Philips, for his
eyes.&mdash;So now I have run over your letter; and I think this
shall go to-morrow, which will be just a fortnight from the last,
and bring things to the old form again, after your rambles to
Wexford, and mine to Windsor.&nbsp; Are there not many literal
faults in my letters?&nbsp; I never read them over, and I fancy
there are.&nbsp; What do you do then? do you guess my meaning, or
are you acquainted with my manner of mistaking?&nbsp; I lost my
handkerchief in the Mall to-night with Lord Radnor; but I made
him walk with me to find it, and find it I did not.&nbsp; Tisdall
<a name="citation278"></a><a href="#footnote278"
class="citation">[278]</a> (that lodges with me) and I have had
no conversation, nor do we pull off our hats in the
streets.&nbsp; There is a <a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>cousin of his (I suppose,) a young
parson, that lodges in the house too; a handsome, genteel
fellow.&nbsp; Dick Tighe <a name="citation279a"></a><a
href="#footnote279a" class="citation">[279a]</a> and his wife
lodged over against us; and he has been seen, out of our upper
windows, beating her two or three times: they are both gone to
Ireland, but not together; and he solemnly vows never to live
with her.&nbsp; Neighbours do not stick to say that she has a
tongue: in short, I am told she is the most urging, provoking
devil that ever was born; and he a hot, whiffling <a
name="citation279b"></a><a href="#footnote279b"
class="citation">[279b]</a> puppy, very apt to resent.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll keep this bottom till to-morrow: I&rsquo;m sleepy.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; I was with the Secretary this morning, who was in a
mighty hurry, and went to Windsor in a chariot with Lord Keeper;
so I was not invited, and am forced to stay at home, but not at
all against my will; for I could have gone, and would not.&nbsp;
I dined in the City with one of my printers, for whom I got the
<i>Gazette</i>, and am come home early; and have nothing to say
to you more, but finish this letter, and not send it by the
bellman.&nbsp; Days grow short, and the weather grows bad, and
the town is splenetic, and things are so oddly contrived that I
cannot be absent; otherwise I would go for a few days to Oxford,
as I promised.&mdash;They say it is certain that Prior has been
in France, <a name="citation279c"></a><a href="#footnote279c"

ask the Secretary, he was in such haste.&nbsp; Well, I will take
my leave of dearest MD for a while; for I must begin my next
letter to-night: consider that, young women; and pray be merry,
and good girls, and love Presto.&nbsp; There <a

ticklish; I dare say nothing at this distance.&nbsp; Farewell,
dear sirrahs, dearest lives: there is peace and quiet with MD,
and nowhere else.&nbsp; They have not leisure here to think of
small things, which may ruin them; and I have been forward
enough.&nbsp; Farewell again, dearest rogues; I am never happy
but when I write or think of MD.&nbsp; I have enough of Courts

honour come away this moment, I would.&nbsp; Bernage <a

<h3>LETTER XXIX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Aug.</i> 25, 1711.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> got a pretty small gilt
sheet of paper, to write to MD.&nbsp; I have this moment sent my
28th by Patrick, who tells me he has put it in the post-office;
&rsquo;tis directed to your lodgings: if it wants more particular
direction, you must set me right.&nbsp; It is now a solar month
and two days since the date of your last, N. 18; and I reckon you
are now quiet at home, and thinking to begin your 19th, which
will be full of your quarrel between the two Houses, all which I
know already.&nbsp; Where shall I dine to-morrow? can you
tell?&nbsp; Mrs. Vanhomrigh boards now, and cannot invite one;
and there I used to dine when I was at a loss: and all my friends
are gone out of town, and your town is now at the fullest, with
your Parliament and Convocation.&nbsp; But let me alone, sirrahs;
for Presto is going to be very busy; not Presto, but the other
I.</p>
<p><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>26.&nbsp; People have so left the town that I am at a
loss for a dinner.&nbsp; It is a long time since I have been at
London upon a Sunday; and the Ministers are all at Windsor.&nbsp;
It cost me eighteenpence in coach-hire before I could find a
place to dine in.&nbsp; I went to Frankland&rsquo;s, <a
name="citation281a"></a><a href="#footnote281a"
class="citation">[281a]</a> and he was abroad, and the drab his
wife looked out at window, and bowed to me without inviting me
up: so I dined with Mr. Coote, <a name="citation281b"></a><a
href="#footnote281b" class="citation">[281b]</a> my Lord
Mountrath&rsquo;s brother; my lord is with you in Ireland.&nbsp;
This morning at five my Lord Jersey <a name="citation281c"></a><a
href="#footnote281c" class="citation">[281c]</a> died of the gout
in his stomach, or apoplexy, or both: he was abroad yesterday,
and his death was sudden.&nbsp; He was Chamberlain to King
William, and a great favourite, turned out by the Queen as a
Tory, and stood now fair to be Privy Seal; and by his death will,
I suppose, make that matter easier, which has been a very
stubborn business at Court, as I have been informed.&nbsp; I
never remember so many people of quality to have died in so short
a time.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; I went to-day into the City, to thank Stratford for
my books, and dine with him, and settle my affairs of my money in
the Bank, and receive a bill for Mrs. Wesley for some things I am
to buy for her; and the d&mdash; a one of all these could I
do.&nbsp; The merchants were all out of town, and I was forced to
go to a little hedge place for my dinner.&nbsp; May my enemies
live here in summer! and yet I am so unlucky that I cannot
possibly be out of the way at this juncture.&nbsp; People leave
the town so late in summer, and return so late in winter, that
they have almost inverted the seasons.&nbsp; It is autumn this
good while in St. James&rsquo;s Park; the limes have been losing
their leaves, and those remaining on the trees are all parched: I
hate this season, where everything grows worse and worse.&nbsp;
The only good thing of it is the fruit, and <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>that I dare
not eat.&nbsp; Had you any fruit at Wexford?&nbsp; A few
cherries, and durst not eat them.&nbsp; I do not hear we have yet
got a new Privy Seal.&nbsp; The Whigs whisper that our new
Ministry differ among themselves, and they begin to talk out Mr.
Secretary: they have some reasons for their whispers, although I
thought it was a greater secret.&nbsp; I do not much like the
posture of things; I always apprehended that any falling out
would ruin them, and so I have told them several times.&nbsp; The
Whigs are mighty full of hopes at present; and whatever is the
matter, all kind of stocks fall.&nbsp; I have not yet talked with
the Secretary about Prior&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; I should be apt
to think it may foretell a peace, and that is all we have to
preserve us.&nbsp; The Secretary is not come from Windsor, but I
expect him to-morrow.&nbsp; Burn all politics!</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; We begin to have fine weather, and I walked to-day
to Chelsea, and dined with the Dean of Carlisle, who is laid up
with the gout.&nbsp; It is now fixed that he is to be Dean of
Christ Church in Oxford.&nbsp; I was advising him to use his
interest to prevent any misunderstanding between our Ministers;
but he is too wise to meddle, though he fears the thing and the
consequences as much as I.&nbsp; He will get into his own warm,
quiet deanery, and leave them to themselves; and he is in the
right.&mdash;When I came home to-night, I found a letter from Mr.
Lewis, who is now at Windsor; and in it, forsooth, another which
looked like Presto&rsquo;s hand; and what should it be but a 19th
from MD?&nbsp; O, faith, I &rsquo;scaped narrowly, for I sent my
28th but on Saturday; and what should I have done if I had two
letters to answer at once?&nbsp; I did not expect another from
Wexford, that is certain.&nbsp; Well, I must be contented; but
you are dear saucy girls, for all that, to write so soon again,
faith; an&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord Abercorn, and took my leave
of them: they set out to-morrow for Chester, and, I believe, will
now fix in Ireland.&nbsp; They have made a pretty good journey of
it: his eldest son <a name="citation282"></a><a
href="#footnote282" class="citation">[282]</a> is married to a
lady with ten <a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>thousand pounds; and his second son <a
name="citation283a"></a><a href="#footnote283a"
class="citation">[283a]</a> has, t&rsquo;other day, got a prize
in the lottery of four thousand pounds, beside two small ones of
two hundred pounds each: nay, the family was so fortunate, that
my lord bestowing one ticket, which is a hundred pounds, to one
of his servants, who had been his page, the young fellow got a
prize, which has made it another hundred.&nbsp; I went in the
evening to Lord Treasurer, who desires I will dine with him
to-morrow, when he will show me the answer he designs to return
to the letter of thanks from your bishops in Ireland.&nbsp; The
Archbishop of Dublin desired me to get myself mentioned in the
answer which my lord would send; but I sent him word I would not
open my lips to my lord upon it.&nbsp; He says it would convince
the bishops of what I have affirmed, that the First-Fruits were
granted before the Duke of Ormond was declared Governor; and I
writ to him that I would not give a farthing to convince
them.&nbsp; My Lord Treasurer began a health to my Lord Privy
Seal: Prior punned, and said it was so privy, he knew not who it
was; but I fancy they have fixed it all, and we shall know
to-morrow.&nbsp; But what care you who is Privy Seal, saucy
sluttikins?</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; When I went out this morning, I was surprised with
the news that the Bishop of Bristol is made Lord Privy
Seal.&nbsp; You know his name is Robinson, <a
name="citation283b"></a><a href="#footnote283b"
class="citation">[283b]</a> and that he was many years Envoy in
Sweden.&nbsp; All the friends of the present Ministry are
extremely glad, and the clergy above the rest.&nbsp; The Whigs
will fret to death to see a civil employment given to a
clergyman.&nbsp; It was a very handsome thing in my Lord
Treasurer, and will bind the Church to him for ever.&nbsp; I
dined with him to-day, but he had not written his letter; <a
name="citation283c"></a><a href="#footnote283c"
class="citation">[283c]</a> <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>but told me he would not offer to
send it without showing it to me: he thought that would not be
just, since I was so deeply concerned in the affair.&nbsp; We had
much company: Lord Rivers, Mar, <a name="citation284a"></a><a
href="#footnote284a" class="citation">[284a]</a> and Kinnoull, <a
name="citation284b"></a><a href="#footnote284b"
class="citation">[284b]</a> Mr. Secretary, George Granville, and
Masham: the last has invited me to the christening of his son
to-morrow se&rsquo;ennight; and on Saturday I go to Windsor with
Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; Dilly and I walked to-day to Kensington to Lady
Mountjoy, who invited us to dinner.&nbsp; He returned soon, to go
to a play, it being the last that will be acted for some time: he
dresses himself like a beau, and no doubt makes a fine
figure.&nbsp; I went to visit some people at Kensington: Ophy
Butler&rsquo;s wife <a name="citation284c"></a><a
href="#footnote284c" class="citation">[284c]</a> there lies very
ill of an ague, which is a very common disease here, and little
known in Ireland. I am apt to think we shall soon have a peace,
by the little words I hear thrown out by the Ministry.&nbsp; I
have just thought of a project to bite the town.&nbsp; I have
told you that it is now known that Mr. Prior has been lately in
France.&nbsp; I will make a printer of my own sit by me one day,
and I will dictate to him a formal relation of Prior&rsquo;s
journey, <a name="citation284d"></a><a href="#footnote284d"
class="citation">[284d]</a> with several particulars, all pure
invention; and I doubt not but it will take.</p>
<p>Sept. 1.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I go to-day to Windsor with Mr.
Secretary; and Lord Treasurer has promised to bring me
back.&nbsp; The weather has been fine for some time, and I
believe we shall have a great deal of dust.&mdash;At night.&nbsp;
Windsor.&nbsp; The Secretary and I dined to-day at Parson&rsquo;s
Green, at my Lord Peterborow&rsquo;s house, who has left it and
his gardens to the Secretary during his absence.&nbsp; It is the
finest garden I have ever seen about this town; and abundance <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>of hot
walls for grapes, where they are in great plenty, and ripening
fast.&nbsp; I durst not eat any fruit but one fig; but I brought
a basket full to my friend Lewis here at Windsor.&nbsp; Does
Stella never eat any? what, no apricots at Donnybrook! nothing
but claret and ombre!&nbsp; I envy people maunching and maunching
peaches and grapes, and I not daring to eat a bit.&nbsp; My head
is pretty well, only a sudden turn any time makes me giddy for a
moment, and sometimes it feels very stuffed; but if it grows no
worse, I can bear it very well.&nbsp; I take all opportunities of
walking; and we have a delicious park here just joining to the
Castle, and an avenue in the great park very wide and two miles
long, set with a double row of elms on each side.&nbsp; Were you
ever at Windsor?&nbsp; I was once, a great while ago; but had
quite forgotten it.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Queen has the gout, and did not come to chapel,
nor stir out from her chamber, but received the sacrament there,
as she always does the first Sunday in the month.&nbsp; Yet we
had a great Court; and, among others, I saw your Ingoldsby, <a
name="citation285a"></a><a href="#footnote285a"
class="citation">[285a]</a> who, seeing me talk very familiarly
with the Keeper, Treasurer, etc., came up and saluted me, and
began a very impertinent discourse about the siege of
Bouchain.&nbsp; I told him I could not answer his questions, but
I would bring him one that should; so I went and fetched Sutton
(who brought over the express about a month ago), and delivered
him to the General, and bid him answer his questions; and so I
left them together.&nbsp; Sutton after some time comes back in a
rage, finds me with Lord Rivers and Masham, and there complains
of the trick I had played him, and swore he had been plagued to
death with Ingoldsby&rsquo;s talk.&nbsp; But he told me Ingoldsby
asked him what I meant by bringing him; so, I suppose, he smoked
me a little.&nbsp; So we laughed, etc.&nbsp; My Lord Willoughby,
<a name="citation285b"></a><a href="#footnote285b"
class="citation">[285b]</a> who is one of the chaplains, and
Prebendary of Windsor, read prayers last night to the family; and
the Bishop of Bristol, who is Dean of Windsor, officiated last
night at the Cathedral.&nbsp; This they do to be popular; and it
pleases mightily.&nbsp; I dined with Mr. <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>Masham,
because he lets me have a select company: for the Court here have
got by the end a good thing I said to the Secretary some weeks
ago.&nbsp; He showed me his bill of fare, to tempt me to dine
with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poh,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I value not
your bill of fare; give me your bill of company.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Lord Treasurer was mightily pleased, and told it everybody as a
notable thing.&nbsp; I reckon upon returning to-morrow: they say
the Bishop will then have the Privy Seal delivered him at a great
Council.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Windsor still.&nbsp; The Council was held so late
to-day that I do not go back to town till to-morrow.&nbsp; The
Bishop was sworn Privy Councillor, and had the Privy Seal given
him: and now the patents are passed for those who were this long
time to be made lords or earls.&nbsp; Lord Raby, <a
name="citation286"></a><a href="#footnote286"
class="citation">[286]</a> who is Earl of Strafford, is on
Thursday to marry a namesake of Stella&rsquo;s; the daughter of
Sir H. Johnson in the City; he has three-score thousand pounds
with her, ready money; besides the rest at the father&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; I have got my friend Stratford to be one of the
directors of the South Sea Company, who were named to-day.&nbsp;
My Lord Treasurer did it for me a month ago; and one of those
whom I got to be printer of the <i>Gazette</i> I am recommending
to be printer to the same company.&nbsp; He treated Mr. Lewis and
me to-day at dinner.&nbsp; I supped last night and this with Lord
Treasurer, Keeper, etc., and took occasion to mention the
printer.&nbsp; I said it was the same printer whom my Lord
Treasurer has appointed to print for the South Sea Company.&nbsp;
He denied, and I insisted on it; and I got the laugh on my
side.</p>
<p>London, 4.&nbsp; I came as far as Brentford in Lord
Rivers&rsquo;s chariot, who had business with Lord Treasurer;
then I went into Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We stopped at
Kensington, where Lord Treasurer went to see Mrs. Masham, who is
now what they call in the straw.&nbsp; We got to town by three,
and <a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>I
lighted at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s, who commanded me not to stir:
but I was not well; and when he went up, I begged the young lord
to excuse me, and so went into the City by water, where I could
be easier, and dined with the printer, and dictated to him some
part of Prior&rsquo;s <i>Journey to France</i>.&nbsp; I walked
from the City, for I take all occasions of exercise.&nbsp; Our
journey was horridly dusty.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; When I went out to-day, I found it had rained
mightily in the night, and the streets were as dirty as winter:
it is very refreshing after ten days dry.&mdash;I went into the
City, and dined with Stratford, thanked him for his books, gave
him joy of his being director, of which he had the first notice
by a letter from me.&nbsp; I ate sturgeon, and it lies on my
stomach.&nbsp; I almost finished Prior&rsquo;s <i>Journey</i> at
the printer&rsquo;s; and came home pretty late, with Patrick at
my heels.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; But what shall we do about this letter
of MD&rsquo;s, N. 19?&nbsp; Not a word answered yet, and so much
paper spent!&nbsp; I cannot do anything in it, sweethearts, till
night.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; O Lord, O Lord! the greatest
disgrace that ever was has happened to Presto.&nbsp; What do you
think? but, when I was going out this forenoon a letter came from
MD, N. 20, dated Dublin.&nbsp; O dear, O dear!&nbsp; O sad, O
sad!&mdash;Now I have two letters together to answer: here they
are, lying together.&nbsp; But I will only answer the first; for
I came in late.&nbsp; I dined with my friend Lewis at his
lodgings, and walked at six to Kensington to Mrs. Masham&rsquo;s
son&rsquo;s christening.&nbsp; It was very private; nobody there
but my Lord Treasurer, his son and son-in-law, that is to say,
Lord Harley and Lord Dupplin, and Lord Rivers and I.&nbsp; The
Dean of Rochester <a name="citation287a"></a><a
href="#footnote287a" class="citation">[287a]</a> christened the
child, but soon went away.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer and Lord Rivers
were godfathers; and Mrs. Hill, <a name="citation287b"></a><a
href="#footnote287b" class="citation">[287b]</a> Mrs.
Masham&rsquo;s sister, godmother.&nbsp; The child roared like a
bull, and I gave Mrs. Masham joy of it; and she charged me to
take care of my nephew, because, Mr. Masham being a brother of
our Society, his son, you know, <a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>is consequently a nephew.&nbsp; Mrs.
Masham sat up dressed in bed, but not, as they do in Ireland,
with all smooth about her, as if she was cut off in the middle;
for you might see the counterpane (what d&rsquo;ye call it?) rise
about her hips and body.&nbsp; There is another name of the
counterpane; and you will laugh now, sirrahs.&nbsp; George
Granville came in at supper, and we stayed till eleven; and Lord
Treasurer set me down at my lodging in Suffolk Street.&nbsp; Did
I ever tell you that Lord Treasurer hears ill with the left ear,
just as I do?&nbsp; He always turns the right, and his servants
whisper him at that only.&nbsp; I dare not tell him that I am so
too, for fear he should think I counterfeited, to make my
court.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; You must read this before the other; for I mistook,
and forgot to write yesterday&rsquo;s journal, it was so
insignificant.&nbsp; I dined with Dr. Cockburn, and sat the
evening with Lord Treasurer till ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; On
Thursdays he has always a large select company, and expects
me.&nbsp; So good-night for last night, etc.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I go to Windsor with Lord Treasurer
to-day, and will leave this behind me, to be sent to the
post.&nbsp; And now let us hear what says the first letter, N.
19.&nbsp; You are still at Wexford, as you say, Madam
Dingley.&nbsp; I think no letter from me ever yet
miscarried.&nbsp; And so Inish-Corthy, <a
name="citation288a"></a><a href="#footnote288a"
class="citation">[288a]</a> and the river Slainy; fine words
those in a lady&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; Your hand like
Dingley&rsquo;s, you scambling, <a name="citation288b"></a><a
href="#footnote288b" class="citation">[288b]</a> scattering
sluttikin!&nbsp; <i>Yes</i>, <i>mighty like indeed</i>, <i>is not
it</i>? <a name="citation288c"></a><a href="#footnote288c"
class="citation">[288c]</a>&nbsp; Pisshh, do not talk of writing
or reading till your eyes are well, and long well; only I would
have Dingley read sometimes to you, that you may not lose the
desire of it.&nbsp; God be thanked, that the ugly numbing is
gone!&nbsp; Pray use exercise when you go to town.&nbsp; What
game is that ombra which Dr. Elwood <a name="citation288d"></a><a
href="#footnote288d" class="citation">[288d]</a> and you play at?
is it the Spanish game ombre?&nbsp; Your card-purse? you a
card-purse! you a fiddlestick.&nbsp; You have luck <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>indeed; and
luck in a bag.&nbsp; What a devil! is that eight-shilling
tea-kettle copper, or tin japanned?&nbsp; It is like your Irish
politeness, raffling for tea-kettles.&nbsp; What a splutter you
keep, to convince me that Walls has no taste!&nbsp; My head
continues pretty well.&nbsp; Why do you write, dear sirrah
Stella, when you find your eyes so weak that you cannot see? what
comfort is there in reading what you write, when one knows
that?&nbsp; So Dingley cannot write, because of the clutter of
new company come to Wexford!&nbsp; I suppose the noise of their
hundred horses disturbs you; or do you lie in one gallery, as in
an hospital?&nbsp; What! you are afraid of losing in Dublin the
acquaintance you have got in Wexford, and chiefly the Bishop of
Raphoe, <a name="citation289a"></a><a href="#footnote289a"
class="citation">[289a]</a> an old, doting, perverse
coxcomb?&nbsp; Twenty at a time at breakfast.&nbsp; That is like
five pounds at a time, when it was never but once.&nbsp; I doubt,
Madam Dingley, you are apt to lie in your travels, though not so
bad as Stella; she tells thumpers, as I shall prove in my next,
if I find this receives encouragement.&mdash;So Dr. Elwood says
there are a world of pretty things in my works.&nbsp; A pox on
his praises! an enemy here would say more.&nbsp; The Duke of
Buckingham would say as much, though he and I are terribly fallen
out; and the great men are perpetually inflaming me against him:
they bring me all he says of me, and, I believe, make it worse
out of roguery.&mdash;No, &rsquo;tis not your pen is bewitched,
Madam Stella, but your old <i>scrawling</i>, <i>splay-foot
pot-hooks</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>s</i>, <a name="citation289b"></a><a
href="#footnote289b" class="citation">[289b]</a> ay that&rsquo;s
it: there the s, s, s, there, there, that&rsquo;s exact.&nbsp;
Farewell, etc.</p>
<p>Our fine weather is gone; and I doubt we shall have a rainy
journey to-day.&nbsp; Faith, &rsquo;tis shaving-day, and I have
much to do.&nbsp; When Stella says her pen was bewitched, it was
only because there was a hair in it.&nbsp; You know, the fellow
they call God-help-it had the same thoughts of his wife, and for
the same reason.&nbsp; I think this is very well observed, and I
unfolded the letter to tell you it.</p>
<p><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>Cut
off those two notes above; and see the nine pounds indorsed, and
receive the other; and send me word how my accounts stand, that
they may be adjusted by Nov. 1. <a name="citation290a"></a><a
href="#footnote290a" class="citation">[290a]</a>&nbsp; Pray be
very particular; but the twenty pounds I lend you is not to be
included: so make no blunder.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t wrong you, nor
you shan&rsquo;t wrong me; that is the short.&nbsp; O Lord, how
stout Presto is of late!&nbsp; But he loves MD more than his life
a thousand times, for all his stoutness; tell them that; and that
I&rsquo;ll swear it, as hope saved, ten millions of times, etc.
etc.</p>
<p>I open my letter once more, to tell Stella that if she does
not use exercise after her waters, it will lose all the effects
of them: I should not live if I did not take all opportunities of
walking.&nbsp; Pray, pray, do this, to oblige poor Presto.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Windsor</span>,
<i>Sept.</i> 8, 1711.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">made</span> the coachman stop, and put
in my twenty-ninth at the post-office at two o&rsquo;clock
to-day, as I was going to Lord Treasurer, with whom I dined, and
came here by a quarter-past eight; but the moon shone, and so we
were not in much danger of overturning; which, however, he values
not a straw, and only laughs when I chide at him for it.&nbsp;
There was nobody but he and I, and we supped together, with Mr.
Masham, and Dr. Arbuthnot, the Queen&rsquo;s favourite physician,
a Scotchman.&nbsp; I could not keep myself awake after supper,
but did all I was able to disguise it, and thought I came off
clear; but, at parting, he told me I had got my nap
already.&nbsp; It is now one o&rsquo;clock; but he loves sitting
up late.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; The Queen is still in the gout, but recovering: she
saw company in her bed-chamber after church; but the crowd was so
great, I could not see her.&nbsp; I dined with my brother Sir
William Wyndham, <a name="citation290b"></a><a
href="#footnote290b" class="citation">[290b]</a> and some others
of our Society, to avoid the great tables on Sunday at Windsor,
which I hate.&nbsp; <a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>The usual company supped to-night at
Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s, which was Lord Keeper, Mr. Secretary,
George Granville, Masham, Arbuthnot, and I.&nbsp; But showers
have hindered me from walking to-day, and that I do not
love.&mdash;Noble fruit, and I dare not eat a bit.&nbsp; I ate
one fig to-day, and sometimes a few mulberries, because it is
said they are wholesome, and you know a good name does
much.&nbsp; I shall return to town to-morrow, though I thought to
have stayed a week, to be at leisure for something I am
doing.&nbsp; But I have put it off till next; for I shall come
here again on Saturday, when our Society are to meet at supper at
Mr. Secretary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; My life is very regular here: on
Sunday morning I constantly visit Lord Keeper, and sup at Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s with the same set of company.&nbsp; I was not
sleepy to-night; I resolved I would not; yet it is past midnight
at this present writing.</p>
<p>London, 10.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer and Masham and I left Windsor
at three this afternoon: we dropped Masham at Kensington with his
lady, and got home by six.&nbsp; It was seven before we sat down
to dinner, and I stayed till past eleven.&nbsp; Patrick came home
with the Secretary: I am more plagued with Patrick and my
portmantua than with myself.&nbsp; I forgot to tell you that when
I went to Windsor on Saturday I overtook Lady Giffard and Mrs.
Fenton <a name="citation291a"></a><a href="#footnote291a"
class="citation">[291a]</a> in a chariot, going, I suppose, to
Sheen.&nbsp; I was then in a chariot too, of Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s brother, who had business with the Treasurer;
and my lord came after, and overtook me at Turnham Green, four
miles from London; and then the brother went back, and I went in
the coach with Lord Treasurer: so it happened that those people
saw me, and not with Lord Treasurer.&nbsp; Mrs. F. was to see me
about a week ago; and desired I would get her son into the
Charter-house.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; This morning the printer sent me an account of
Prior&rsquo;s <i>Journey</i>; <a name="citation291b"></a><a
href="#footnote291b" class="citation">[291b]</a> it makes a
twopenny pamphlet.&nbsp; I suppose you will see it, for I dare
engage it will run; &rsquo;tis a formal, grave lie, from the
beginning to the end.&nbsp; I writ all but about the last page;
that I dictated, and the printer writ.&nbsp; <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>Mr.
Secretary sent to me to dine where he did; it was at
Prior&rsquo;s: when I came in, Prior showed me the pamphlet,
seemed to be angry, and said, &ldquo;Here is our English
liberty!&rdquo;&nbsp; I read some of it, and said I liked it
mightily, and envied the rogue the thought; for, had it come into
my head, I should have certainly done it myself.&nbsp; We stayed
at Prior&rsquo;s till past ten; and then the Secretary received a
packet with the news of Bouchain being taken, for which the guns
will go off to-morrow.&nbsp; Prior owned his having been in
France, for it was past denying: it seems he was discovered by a
rascal at Dover, who had positive orders to let him pass.&nbsp; I
believe we shall have a peace.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; It is terrible rainy weather, and has cost me three
shillings in coaches and chairs to-day, yet I was dirty into the
bargain.&nbsp; I was three hours this morning with the Secretary
about some business of moment, and then went into the City to
dine.&nbsp; The printer tells me he sold yesterday a thousand of
Prior&rsquo;s <i>Journey</i>, and had printed five hundred
more.&nbsp; It will do rarely, I believe, and is a pure
bite.&nbsp; And what is MD doing all this while? got again to
their cards, their Walls, their deans, their Stoytes, and their
claret?&nbsp; Pray present my service to Mr. Stoyte and
Catherine.&nbsp; Tell Goody Stoyte she owes me a world of
dinners, and I will shortly come over and demand them.&mdash;Did
I tell you of the Archbishop of Dublin&rsquo;s last letter?&nbsp;
He had been saying, in several of his former, that he would
shortly write to me something about myself; and it looked as if
he intended something for me: at last out it comes, and consists
of two parts.&nbsp; First, he advises me to strike in for some
preferment now I have friends; and secondly, he advises me, since
I have parts, and learning, and a happy pen, to think of some new
subject in divinity not handled by others, which I should manage
better than anybody.&nbsp; A rare spark this, with a pox! but I
shall answer him as rarely.&nbsp; Methinks he should have invited
me over, and given me some hopes or promises.&nbsp; But hang him!
and so good-night, etc.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; It rained most furiously all this morning till about
<a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>twelve,
and sometimes thundered; I trembled for my shillings, but it
cleared up, and I made a shift to get a walk in the Park, and
then went with the Secretary to dine with Lord Treasurer.&nbsp;
Upon Thursdays there is always a select company: we had the Duke
of Shrewsbury, Lord Rivers, the two Secretaries, Mr. Granville,
and Mr. Prior.&nbsp; Half of them went to Council at six; but
Rivers, Granville, Prior, and I, stayed till eight.&nbsp; Prior
was often affecting to be angry at the account of his journey to
Paris; and indeed the two last pages, which the printer got
somebody to add, <a name="citation293a"></a><a
href="#footnote293a" class="citation">[293a]</a> are so romantic,
they spoil all the rest.&nbsp; Dilly Ashe pretended to me that he
was only going to Oxford and Cambridge for a fortnight, and then
would come back.&nbsp; I could not see him as I appointed
t&rsquo;other day; but some of his friends tell me he took leave
of them as going to Ireland; and so they say at his
lodging.&nbsp; I believe the rogue was ashamed to tell me so,
because I advised him to stay the winter, and he said he
would.&nbsp; I find he had got into a good set of scrub
acquaintance, and I thought passed his time very merrily; but I
suppose he languished after Balderig, and the claret of Dublin;
and, after all, I think he is in the right; for he can eat,
drink, and converse better there than here.&nbsp; Bernage was
with me this morning: he calls now and then; he is in terrible
fear of a peace.&nbsp; He said he never had his health so well as
in Portugal.&nbsp; He is a favourite of his Colonel.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; I was mortified enough to-day, not knowing where in
the world to dine, the town is so empty.&nbsp; I met H. Coote, <a
name="citation293b"></a><a href="#footnote293b"
class="citation">[293b]</a> and thought he would invite me, but
he did not: Sir John Stanley did not come into my head; so I took
up with Mrs. Van, and dined with her and her damned landlady,
who, I believe, by her eyebrows, is a bawd.&nbsp; This evening I
met Addison and Pastoral Philips in the Park, and supped with
them at Addison&rsquo;s lodgings: we were very good company, and
I yet know no man half so agreeable to me as he is.&nbsp; I sat
with them till twelve, so you may think it is late, young women;
however, I would have some little conversation with <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>MD before
your Presto goes to bed, because it makes me sleep, and dream,
and so forth.&nbsp; Faith, this letter goes on slowly enough,
sirrahs; but I cannot write much at a time till you are quite
settled after your journey, you know, and have gone all your
visits, and lost your money at ombre.&nbsp; You never play at
chess now, Stella.&nbsp; That puts me in mind of Dick Tighe; I
fancy I told you he used to beat his wife here; and she deserved
it; and he resolves to part with her; and they went to Ireland in
different coaches.&nbsp; O Lord, I said all this before, I am
sure.&nbsp; Go to bed, sirrahs.</p>
<p>Windsor, 15.&nbsp; I made the Secretary stop at Brentford,
because we set out at two this afternoon, and fasting would not
agree with me.&nbsp; I only designed to eat a bit of
bread-and-butter; but he would light, and we ate roast beef like
dragons.&nbsp; And he made me treat him and two more gentlemen;
faith, it cost me a guinea.&nbsp; I do not like such jesting, yet
I was mightily pleased with it too.&nbsp; To-night our Society
met at the Secretary&rsquo;s: there were nine of us; and we have
chosen a new member, the Earl of Jersey, <a
name="citation294a"></a><a href="#footnote294a"
class="citation">[294a]</a> whose father died lately.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis past one, and I have stolen away.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; I design to stay here this week by myself, about
some business that lies on my hands, and will take up a great
deal of time.&nbsp; Dr. Adams, <a name="citation294b"></a><a
href="#footnote294b" class="citation">[294b]</a> one of the
canons, invited me to-day to dinner.&nbsp; The tables are so full
here on Sunday that it is hard to dine with a few, and Dr. Adams
knows I love to do so; which is very obliging.&nbsp; The Queen
saw company in her bed-chamber; she looks very well, but she sat
down.&nbsp; I supped with Lord Treasurer as usual, and stayed
till past one as usual, and with our usual company, except Lord
Keeper, who did not come this time to Windsor.&nbsp; I hate these
suppers mortally, but I seldom eat anything.</p>
<p><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>17.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer and Mr. Secretary stay here
till to-morrow; some business keeps them, and I am sorry for it,
for they hinder me a day.&nbsp; Mr. Lewis and I were going to
dine soberly with a little Court friend at one.&nbsp; But Lord
Harley and Lord Dupplin kept me by force, and said we should dine
at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s, who intended to go at four to
London.&nbsp; I stayed like a fool, and went with the two young
lords to Lord Treasurer, who very fairly turned us all three out
of doors.&nbsp; They both were invited to the Duke of Somerset,
but he was gone to a horse-race, and would not come till five; so
we were forced to go to a tavern, and sent for wine from Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s, who at last, we were told, did not go to town
till the morrow, and at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s we supped again;
and I desired him to let me add four shillings to the bill I gave
him.&nbsp; We sat up till two, yet I must write to little MD.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; They are all gone early this morning, and I am alone
to seek my fortune; but Dr. Arbuthnot engages me for my dinners;
and he yesterday gave me my choice of place, person, and victuals
for to-day.&nbsp; So I chose to dine with Mrs. Hill, who is one
of the dressers, and Mrs. Masham&rsquo;s sister, no company but
us three, and to have a shoulder of mutton, a small one; which
was exactly, only there was too much victuals besides; and the
Doctor&rsquo;s wife <a name="citation295a"></a><a
href="#footnote295a" class="citation">[295a]</a> was of the
company.&nbsp; And to-morrow Mrs. Hill and I are to dine with the
Doctor.&nbsp; I have seen a fellow often about Court whom I
thought I knew.&nbsp; I asked who he was, and they told me it was
the gentleman porter; then I called him to mind; he was
Killy&rsquo;s acquaintance (I won&rsquo;t say yours); I think his
name is Lovet, <a name="citation295b"></a><a href="#footnote295b"
class="citation">[295b]</a> or Lovel, or something like it.&nbsp;
I believe he does not know me, and in my present posture I shall
not be fond of renewing old acquaintance; I believe I used to see
him with the Bradleys; and, by the way, I have not seen Mrs.
Bradley since I came to England.&nbsp; I left your letter in
London, like a fool; and cannot answer it till I go back, <a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>which will
not be until Monday next; so this will be above a fortnight from
my last; but I will fetch it up in my next; so go and walk to the
Dean&rsquo;s for your health this fine weather.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; The Queen designs to have cards and dancing here
next week, which makes us think she will stay here longer than we
believed.&nbsp; Mrs. Masham is not well after her lying-in: I
doubt she got some cold; she is lame in one of her legs with a
rheumatic pain.&nbsp; Dr. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Hill go to-morrow to
Kensington to see her, and return the same night.&nbsp; Mrs. Hill
and I dined with the Doctor to-day.&nbsp; I rode out this morning
with the Doctor to see Cranburn, a house of Lord
Ranelagh&rsquo;s, <a name="citation296a"></a><a
href="#footnote296a" class="citation">[296a]</a> and the Duchess
of Marlborough&rsquo;s lodge, and the Park; the finest places
they are, for nature and plantations, that ever I saw; and the
finest riding upon artificial roads, made on purpose for the
Queen.&nbsp; Arbuthnot made me draw up a sham subscription for a
book, called <i>A History of the Maids of Honour since Harry the
Eighth</i>, showing they make the best wives, with a list of all
the maids of honour since, etc.; to pay a crown in hand, and the
other crown upon delivery of the book; and all in common forms of
those things.&nbsp; We got a gentleman to write it fair, because
my hand is known; and we sent it to the maids of honour, when
they came to supper.&nbsp; If they bite at it, it will be a very
good Court jest; and the Queen will certainly have it: we did not
tell Mrs. Hill.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; To-day I was invited to the Green Cloth by Colonel
Godfrey, who married the Duke of Marlborough&rsquo;s sister, <a
name="citation296b"></a><a href="#footnote296b"
class="citation">[296b]</a> mother to the Duke of Berwick by King
James: I must tell you those things that happened before you were
born.&nbsp; But I made my excuses, and young Harcourt (Lord
Keeper&rsquo;s son) <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>and I dined with my next neighbour,
Dr. Adams. <a name="citation297a"></a><a href="#footnote297a"
class="citation">[297a]</a>&nbsp; Mrs. Masham is better, and will
be here in three or four days.&nbsp; She had need; for the
Duchess of Somerset is thought to gain ground daily.&mdash;We
have not sent you over all your bills; and I think we have
altered your money-bill.&nbsp; The Duke of Ormond is censured
here, by those in power, for very wrong management in the affair
of the mayoralty. <a name="citation297b"></a><a
href="#footnote297b" class="citation">[297b]</a>&nbsp; He is
governed by fools, and has usually much more sense than his
advisers, but never proceeds by it.&nbsp; I must know how your
health continues after Wexford.&nbsp; Walk and use exercise,
sirrahs both; and get somebody to play at shuttlecock with you,
Madam Stella, and walk to the Dean&rsquo;s and Donnybrook.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; Colonel Godfrey sent to me again to-day; so I dined
at the Green Cloth, and we had but eleven at dinner, which is a
small number there, the Court being always thin of company till
Saturday night.&mdash;This new ink and pen make a strange figure;
<i>I must write larger</i>, <i>yes I must</i>, <i>or Stella will
not be able to read this</i>. <a name="citation297c"></a><a
href="#footnote297c" class="citation">[297c]</a>&nbsp; S. S. S.,
there is your S&rsquo;s for you, Stella.&nbsp; The maids of
honour are bit, and have all contributed their crowns, and are
teasing others to subscribe for the book.&nbsp; I will tell Lord
Keeper and Lord Treasurer to-morrow; and I believe the Queen will
have it.&nbsp; After a little walk this evening, I squandered
away the rest of it in sitting at Lewis&rsquo;s lodging, while he
and Dr. Arbuthnot played at picquet.&nbsp; I have that foolish
pleasure, which I believe nobody has beside me, except old Lady
Berkeley. <a name="citation297d"></a><a href="#footnote297d"
class="citation">[297d]</a>&nbsp; But I fretted when I came away:
I will loiter so no more, for I have a plaguy deal of business
upon my hands, and very little time to do it.&nbsp; The
pamphleteers begin to be very busy against the Ministry: I have
begged Mr. Secretary to make examples of <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>one or two
of them, and he assures me he will.&nbsp; They are very bold and
abusive.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; This being the day the Ministry come to Windsor, I
ate a bit or two at Mr. Lewis&rsquo;s lodgings, because I must
sup with Lord Treasurer; and at half an hour after one, I led Mr.
Lewis a walk up the avenue, which is two miles long.&nbsp; We
walked in all about five miles; but I was so tired with his slow
walking, that I left him here, and walked two miles towards
London, hoping to meet Lord Treasurer, and return with him; but
it grew darkish, and I was forced to walk back, so I walked nine
miles in all; and Lord Treasurer did not come till after eight;
which is very wrong, for there was no moon, and I often tell him
how ill he does to expose himself so; but he only makes a jest of
it.&nbsp; I supped with him, and stayed till now, when it is half
an hour after two.&nbsp; He is as merry and careless and
disengaged as a young heir at one-and-twenty.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
late indeed.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; The Secretary did not come last night, but at three
this afternoon.&nbsp; I have not seen him yet, but I verily think
they are contriving a peace as fast as they can, without which it
will be impossible to subsist.&nbsp; The Queen was at church
to-day, but was carried in a chair.&nbsp; I and Mr. Lewis dined
privately with Mr. Lowman, <a name="citation298"></a><a
href="#footnote298" class="citation">[298]</a> Clerk of the
Kitchen.&nbsp; I was to see Lord Keeper this morning, and told
him the jest of the maids of honour; and Lord Treasurer had it
last night.&nbsp; That rogue Arbuthnot puts it all upon me.&nbsp;
The Court was very full to-day.&nbsp; I expected Lord Treasurer
would have invited me to supper; but he only bowed to me; and we
had no discourse in the drawing-room.&nbsp; It is now seven at
night, and I am at home; and I hope Lord Treasurer will not send
for me to supper: if he does not, I will reproach him; and he
will pretend to chide me for not coming.&mdash;So farewell till I
go to bed, for I am going to be busy.&mdash;It is now past ten,
and I went down to ask the servants about Mr. Secretary: they
tell me the Queen is yet at Council, and that she went to supper,
and came out to the Council afterwards.&nbsp; It is <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>certain
they are managing a peace.&nbsp; I will go to bed, and there is
an end.&mdash;It is now eleven, and a messenger is come from Lord
Treasurer to sup with them; but I have excused myself, and am
glad I am in bed; for else I should sit up till two, and drink
till I was hot.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ll go sleep.</p>
<p>London, 24.&nbsp; I came to town by six with Lord Treasurer,
and have stayed till ten.&nbsp; That of the Queen&rsquo;s going
out to sup, and coming in again, is a lie, as the Secretary told
me this morning; but I find the Ministry are very busy with Mr.
Prior, and I believe he will go again to France.&nbsp; I am told
so much, that we shall certainly have a peace very soon.&nbsp; I
had charming weather all last week at Windsor; but we have had a
little rain to-day, and yesterday was windy.&nbsp; Prior&rsquo;s
<i>Journey</i> sells still; they have sold two thousand, although
the town is empty.&nbsp; I found a letter from Mrs. Fenton here,
desiring me, in Lady Giffard&rsquo;s name, to come and pass a
week at Sheen, while she is at Moor Park.&nbsp; I will answer it
with a vengeance: and now you talk of answering, there is
MD&rsquo;s N. 20 is yet to be answered: I had put it up so safe,
I could hardly find it; but here it is, faith, and I am afraid I
cannot send this till Thursday; for I must see the Secretary
to-morrow morning, and be in some other place in the evening.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; Stella writes like an emperor, and gives such an
account of her journey, never saw the like.&nbsp; Let me see;
stand away, let us compute; you stayed four days at Inish-Corthy,
two nights at Mrs. Proby&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s, and yet was but
six days in journey; for your words are, &ldquo;We left Wexford
this day se&rsquo;ennight, and came here last night.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I have heard them say that &ldquo;travellers may lie by
authority.&rdquo;&nbsp; Make up this, if you can.&nbsp; How far
is it from Wexford to Dublin? how many miles did you travel in a
day? <a name="citation299"></a><a href="#footnote299"
class="citation">[299]</a>&nbsp; Let me see&mdash;thirty pounds
in two months is nine score pounds a year; <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>a matter of
nothing in Stella&rsquo;s purse!&nbsp; I dreamed Billy Swift was
alive, and that I told him you writ me word he was dead, and that
you had been at his funeral; and I admired at your impudence, and
was in mighty haste to run and let you know what lying rogues you
were.&nbsp; Poor lad! he is dead of his mother&rsquo;s former
folly and fondness; and yet now I believe, as you say, that her
grief will soon wear off.&mdash;O yes, Madam Dingley, mightily
tired of the company, no doubt of it, at Wexford!&nbsp; And your
description of it is excellent; clean sheets, but bare walls; I
suppose then you lay upon the walls.&mdash;Mrs. Walls has got her
tea; but who pays me the money?&nbsp; Come, I shall never get it;
so I make a present of it, to stop some gaps, etc.&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s the thanks of the house?&nbsp; So, that&rsquo;s
well; why, it cost four-and-thirty shillings English&mdash;you
must adjust that with Mrs. Walls; I think that is so many pence
more with you.&mdash;No, Leigh and Sterne, I suppose, were not at
the water-side: I fear Sterne&rsquo;s business will not be done;
I have not seen him this good while.&nbsp; I hate him, for the
management of that box; and I was the greatest fool in nature for
trusting to such a young jackanapes; I will speak to him once
more about it, when I see him.&nbsp; Mr. Addison and I met once
more since, and I supped with him; I believe I told you so
somewhere in this letter.&nbsp; The Archbishop chose an admirable
messenger in Walls, to send to me; yet I think him fitter for a
messenger than anything.&mdash;The D&mdash; she has!&nbsp; I did
not observe her looks.&nbsp; Will she rot out of modesty with
Lady Giffard?&nbsp; I pity poor Jenny <a
name="citation300"></a><a href="#footnote300"
class="citation">[300]</a>&mdash;but her husband is a dunce, and
with respect to him she loses little by her deafness.&nbsp; I
believe, Madam Stella, in your accounts you mistook one liquor
for another, and it was an hundred and forty quarts of wine, and
thirty-two of water.&mdash;This is all written in the morning
before I go to the Secretary, as I am now doing.&nbsp; I have
answered your letter a little shorter than ordinary; but I have a
mind it should go to-day, and I will give you my journal at night
in my next; for I&rsquo;m so afraid of another <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>letter
before this goes: I will never have two together again
unanswered.&mdash;What care I for Dr. Tisdall and Dr. Raymond, or
how many children they have!&nbsp; I wish they had a hundred
apiece.&mdash;Lord Treasurer promises me to answer the
bishops&rsquo; letter to-morrow, and show it me; and I believe it
will confirm all I said, and mortify those that threw the merit
on the Duke of Ormond; for I have made him jealous of it; and
t&rsquo;other day, talking of the matter, he said, &ldquo;I am
your witness, you got it for them before the Duke was Lord
Lieutenant.&rdquo;&nbsp; My humble service to Mrs. Walls, Mrs.
Stoyte, and Catherine.&nbsp; Farewell, etc.</p>
<p>What do you do when you see any literal mistakes in my
letters? how do you set them right? for I never read them over to
correct them.&nbsp; Farewell, again.</p>
<p>Pray send this note to Mrs. Brent, to get the money when
Parvisol comes to town, or she can send to him.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXXI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Sept.</i> 25, 1711.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">dined</span> in the City to-day, and at
my return I put my 30th into the post-office; and when I got home
I found for me one of the noblest letters I ever read: it was
from &mdash;, three sides and a half in folio, on a large sheet
of paper; the two first pages made up of satire upon London, and
crowds and hurry, stolen from some of his own schoolboy&rsquo;s
exercises: the side and a half remaining is spent in desiring me
to recommend Mrs. South, your Commissioner&rsquo;s widow, <a
name="citation301"></a><a href="#footnote301"
class="citation">[301]</a> to my Lord Treasurer for a
pension.&nbsp; He is the prettiest, discreetest fellow that ever
my eyes beheld, or that ever dipped pen into ink.&nbsp; I know
not what to say to him.&nbsp; A pox on him, I have too many such
customers on this side already.&nbsp; I think I will send him
word that I never saw my Lord Treasurer in my life: I am sure I
industriously avoided the name of any great person when I saw
him, for fear of his <a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>reporting it in Ireland.&nbsp; And
this recommendation must be a secret too, for fear the Duke of
Bolton <a name="citation302a"></a><a href="#footnote302a"
class="citation">[302a]</a> should know it, and think it was too
mean.&nbsp; I never read so d&mdash;d a letter in my life: a
little would make me send it over to you.&mdash;I must send you a
pattern, the first place I cast my eyes on, I will not pick and
choose.&nbsp; <i>In this place</i> (meaning the Exchange in
London), <i>which is the compendium of old Troynovant</i>, <i>as
that is of the whole busy world</i>, <i>I got such a surfeit</i>,
<i>that I grew sick of mankind</i>, <i>and resolved for ever
after to bury myself in the shady retreat of</i> &mdash;.&nbsp;
You must know that London has been called by some Troynovant, or
New Troy.&nbsp; Will you have any more?&nbsp; Yes, one little bit
for Stella, because she&rsquo;ll be fond of it.&nbsp; This
wondrous theatre (meaning London) was no more to me than a
desert, and I should less complain of solitude in a Connaught
shipwreck, or even the great bog of Allen.&nbsp; A little scrap
for Mrs. Marget, <a name="citation302b"></a><a
href="#footnote302b" class="citation">[302b]</a> and then I have
done.&nbsp; <i>Their royal fanum</i>, <i>wherein the idol Pecunia
is daily worshipped</i>, <i>seemed to me to be just like a hive
of bees working and labouring under huge weights of
cares</i>.&nbsp; Fanum is a temple, but he means the Exchange;
and Pecunia is money: so now Mrs. Marget will understand her
part.&nbsp; One more paragraph, and I&mdash;&nbsp; Well, come,
don&rsquo;t be in such a rage, you shall have no more.&nbsp;
Pray, Stella, be satisfied; &rsquo;tis very pretty: and that I
must be acquainted with such a dog as this!&mdash;Our peace goes
on fast.&nbsp; Prior was with the Secretary two hours this
morning: I was there a little after he went away, and was told
it.&nbsp; I believe he will soon be despatched again to France;
and I will put somebody to write an account of his second
journey: I hope you have seen the other.&nbsp; This latter has
taken up my time with storming at it.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; Bernage has been with me these two days; yesterday I
sent for him to let him know that Dr. Arbuthnot is putting in
strongly to have his brother made a captain over <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>Bernage&rsquo;s <a name="citation303a"></a><a
href="#footnote303a" class="citation">[303a]</a> head.&nbsp;
Arbuthnot&rsquo;s brother is but an ensign, but the Doctor has
great power with the Queen: yet he told me he would not do
anything hard to a gentleman who is my friend; and I have engaged
the Secretary and his Colonel <a name="citation303b"></a><a
href="#footnote303b" class="citation">[303b]</a> for him.&nbsp;
To-day he told me very melancholy, that the other had written
from Windsor (where he went to solicit) that he has got the
company; and Bernage is full of the spleen.&nbsp; I made the
Secretary write yesterday a letter to the Colonel in
Bernage&rsquo;s behalf.&nbsp; I hope it will do yet; and I have
written to Dr. Arbuthnot to Windsor, not to insist on doing such
a hardship.&nbsp; I dined in the City at Pontack&rsquo;s, with
Stratford; it cost me seven shillings: he would have treated, but
I did not let him.&nbsp; I have removed my money from the Bank to
another fund.&nbsp; I desire Parvisol may speak to Hawkshaw to
pay in my money when he can, for I will put it in the funds; and,
in the meantime, borrow so much of Mr. Secretary, who offers to
lend it me.&nbsp; Go to the Dean&rsquo;s, sirrahs.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; Bernage was with me again to-day, and is in great
fear, and so was I; but this afternoon, at Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s, where I dined, my brother, George Granville,
Secretary at War, after keeping me a while in suspense, told me
that Dr. Arbuthnot had waived the business, because he would not
wrong a friend of mine; that his brother is to be a lieutenant,
and Bernage is made a captain.&nbsp; I called at his lodging, and
the soldier&rsquo;s coffee-house, to put him out of pain, but
cannot find him; so I have left word, and shall see him to-morrow
morning, I suppose.&nbsp; Bernage is now easy; he has ten
shillings a day, beside lawful cheating.&nbsp; However, he gives
a private sum to his Colonel, but it is very cheap: his Colonel
loves him well, but is surprised to see him have so many
friends.&nbsp; So he is now quite off my hands.&nbsp; I left the
company early to-night, at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s; but the
Secretary followed me, to desire I would go with him to
W&mdash;.&nbsp; Mr. Lewis&rsquo;s man came in before I could
finish that word beginning with a W, which ought to be Windsor,
and brought me a very handsome rallying letter from Dr. <a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>Arbuthnot,
to tell me he had, in compliance to me, given up his
brother&rsquo;s pretensions in favour of Bernage, this very
morning; that the Queen had spoken to Mr. Granville to make the
company easy in the other&rsquo;s having the captainship.&nbsp;
Whether they have done it to oblige me or no, I must own it
so.&nbsp; He says he this very morning begged Her Majesty to give
Mr. Bernage the company.&nbsp; I am mighty well pleased to have
succeeded so well; but you will think me tedious, although you
like the man, as I think.</p>
<p>Windsor, 28.&nbsp; I came here a day sooner than ordinary, at
Mr. Secretary&rsquo;s desire, and supped with him and Prior, and
two private Ministers from France, and a French priest. <a
name="citation304a"></a><a href="#footnote304a"
class="citation">[304a]</a>&nbsp; I know not the two
Ministers&rsquo; names; but they are come about the peace.&nbsp;
The names the Secretary called them, I suppose, were feigned;
they were good rational men.&nbsp; We have already settled all
things with France, and very much to the honour and advantage of
England; and the Queen is in mighty good humour.&nbsp; All this
news is a mighty secret; the people in general know that a peace
is forwarding.&nbsp; The Earl of Strafford <a
name="citation304b"></a><a href="#footnote304b"
class="citation">[304b]</a> is to go soon to Holland, and let
them know what we have been doing: and then there will be the
devil and all to pay; but we&rsquo;ll make them swallow it with a
pox.&nbsp; The French Ministers stayed with us till one, and the
Secretary and I sat up talking till two; so you will own
&rsquo;tis late, sirrahs, and time for your little saucy Presto
to go to bed and sleep adazy; and God bless poor little MD: I
hope they are now fast asleep, and dreaming of Presto.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer came to-night, as usual, at half an
hour after eight, as dark as pitch.&nbsp; I am weary of chiding
him; so I commended him for observing his friend&rsquo;s advice,
and coming so early, etc.&nbsp; I was two hours with Lady
Oglethorpe <a name="citation304c"></a><a href="#footnote304c"
class="citation">[304c]</a> <a name="page305"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 305</span>to-night, and then supped with Lord
Treasurer, after dining at the Green Cloth: I stayed till two;
this is the effect of Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s being here; I must
sup with him; and he keeps cursed hours.&nbsp; Lord Keeper and
the Secretary were absent; they cannot sit up with him.&nbsp;
This long sitting up makes the periods in my letters so
short.&nbsp; I design to stay here all the next week, to be at
leisure by myself, to finish something of weight I have upon my
hands, and which must soon be done.&nbsp; I shall then think of
returning to Ireland, if these people will let me; and I know
nothing else they have for me to do.&nbsp; I gave Dr. Arbuthnot
my thanks for his kindness to Bernage, whose commission is now
signed.&nbsp; Methinks I long to know something of Stella&rsquo;s
health, how it continues after Wexford waters.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; The Queen was not at chapel to-day, and all for the
better, for we had a dunce to preach: she has a little of the
gout.&nbsp; I dined with my brother Masham, and a moderate
company, and would not go to Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s till after
supper at eleven o&rsquo;clock, and pretended I had mistaken the
hour; so I ate nothing: and a little after twelve the company
broke up, the Keeper and Secretary refusing to stay; so I saved
this night&rsquo;s debauch.&nbsp; Prior went away yesterday with
his Frenchmen, and a thousand reports are raised in this
town.&nbsp; Some said they knew one to be the Abb&eacute; de
Polignac: others swore it was the Abb&eacute; du Bois.&nbsp; The
Whigs are in a rage about the peace; but we&rsquo;ll wherret <a
name="citation305a"></a><a href="#footnote305a"
class="citation">[305a]</a> them, I warrant, boys.&nbsp; Go, go,
go to the Dean&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t mind politics, young
women, they are not good after the waters; they are stark naught:
they strike up into the head.&nbsp; Go, get two black aces, and
fish for a manilio.</p>
<p>Oct. 1.&nbsp; Sir John Walter, <a name="citation305b"></a><a
href="#footnote305b" class="citation">[305b]</a> an honest
drunken fellow, is now in waiting, and invited me to the Green
Cloth to-day, that he might not be behindhand with Colonel
Godfrey, who is a Whig.&nbsp; I was engaged to the Mayor&rsquo;s
feast with <a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>Mr. Masham; but waiting to take leave of Lord
Treasurer, I came too late, and so returned sneaking to the Green
Cloth, and did not see my Lord Treasurer neither; but was
resolved not to lose two dinners for him.&nbsp; I took leave
to-day of my friend and solicitor Lord Rivers, who is commanded
by the Queen to set out for Hanover on Thursday.&nbsp; The
Secretary does not go to town till to-morrow; he and I, and two
friends more, drank a sober bottle of wine here at home, and
parted at twelve; he goes by seven to-morrow morning, so I shall
not see him.&nbsp; I have power over his cellar in his absence,
and make little use of it.&nbsp; Lord Dartmouth and my friend
Lewis stay here this week; but I can never work out a dinner from
Dartmouth.&nbsp; Masham has promised to provide for me: I squired
his lady out of her chaise to-day, and must visit her in a day or
two.&nbsp; So you have had a long fit of the finest weather in
the world; but I am every day in pain that it will go off.&nbsp;
I have done no business to-day; I am very idle.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; My friend Lewis and I, to avoid over much eating and
great tables, dined with honest Jemmy Eckershall, <a
name="citation306"></a><a href="#footnote306"
class="citation">[306]</a> Clerk of the Kitchen, now in waiting,
and I bespoke my dinner: but the cur had your acquaintance Lovet,
the gentleman porter, to be our company.&nbsp; Lovet, towards the
end of dinner, after twenty wrigglings, said he had the honour to
see me formerly at Moor Park, and thought he remembered my
face.&nbsp; I said I thought I remembered him, and was glad to
see him, etc., and I escaped for that much, for he was very
pert.&nbsp; It has rained all this day, and I doubt our good
weather is gone.&nbsp; I have been very idle this afternoon,
playing at twelvepenny picquet with Lewis: I won seven shillings,
which is the only money I won this year: I have not played above
four times, and I think always at Windsor.&nbsp; Cards are very
dear: there is a duty on them of sixpence a pack, which spoils
small gamesters.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Mr. Masham sent this morning to desire I would ride
out with him, the weather growing again very fine.&nbsp; I was <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>very busy,
and sent my excuses; but desired he would provide me a
dinner.&nbsp; I dined with him, his lady, and her sister, Mrs.
Hill, who invites us to-morrow to dine with her, and we are to
ride out in the morning.&nbsp; I sat with Lady Oglethorpe till
eight this evening, then was going home to write; looked about
for the woman that keeps the key of the house: she told me
Patrick had it.&nbsp; I cooled my heels in the cloisters till
nine, then went in to the music-meeting, where I had been often
desired to go; but was weary in half an hour of their fine stuff,
and stole out so privately that everybody saw me; and cooled my
heels in the cloisters again till after ten: then came in
Patrick.&nbsp; I went up, shut the chamber door, and gave him two
or three swinging cuffs on the ear, and I have strained the thumb
of my left hand with pulling him, which I did not feel until he
was gone.&nbsp; He was plaguily afraid and humbled.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; It was the finest day in the world, and we got out
before eleven, a noble caravan of us.&nbsp; The Duchess of
Shrewsbury in her own chaise with one horse, and Miss Touchet <a
name="citation307a"></a><a href="#footnote307a"
class="citation">[307a]</a> with her, Mrs. Masham and Mrs.
Scarborow, one of the dressers, in one of the Queen&rsquo;s
chaises; Miss Forester and Miss Scarborow, <a
name="citation307b"></a><a href="#footnote307b"
class="citation">[307b]</a> two maids of honour, and Mrs. Hill on
horseback.&nbsp; The Duke of Shrewsbury, Mr. Masham, George
Fielding, <a name="citation307c"></a><a href="#footnote307c"
class="citation">[307c]</a> Arbuthnot, and I, on horseback
too.&nbsp; Mrs. Hill&rsquo;s horse was hired for Miss Scarborow,
but she took it in civility; her own horse was galled and could
not be rid, but kicked and winced: the hired horse was not worth
eighteenpence.&nbsp; I borrowed coat, boots, and horse, and in
short we had all the difficulties, and more than we used to have
in making a party from Trim to Longfield&rsquo;s. <a
name="citation307d"></a><a href="#footnote307d"
class="citation">[307d]</a>&nbsp; My coat was light camlet, faced
with red velvet, and silver buttons.&nbsp; We <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>rode in the
great park and the forest about a dozen miles, and the Duchess
and I had much conversation: we got home by two, and Mr. Masham,
his lady, Arbuthnot and I, dined with Mrs. Hill.&nbsp; Arbuthnot
made us all melancholy, by some symptoms of bloody u&mdash;e: he
expects a cruel fit of the stone in twelve hours; he says he is
never mistaken, and he appears like a man that was to be racked
to-morrow.&nbsp; I cannot but hope it will not be so bad; he is a
perfectly honest man, and one I have much obligation to.&nbsp; It
rained a little this afternoon, and grew fair again.&nbsp; Lady
Oglethorpe sent to speak to me, and it was to let me know that
Lady Rochester <a name="citation308a"></a><a href="#footnote308a"
class="citation">[308a]</a> desires she and I may be better
acquainted.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a little too late; for I am not now
in love with Lady Rochester: they shame me out of her, because
she is old.&nbsp; Arbuthnot says he hopes my strained thumb is
not the gout; for he has often found people so mistaken.&nbsp; I
do not remember the particular thing that gave it me, only I had
it just after beating Patrick, and now it is better; so I believe
he is mistaken.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The Duchess of Shrewsbury sent to invite me to
dinner; but I was abroad last night when her servant came, and
this morning I sent my excuses, because I was engaged, which I
was sorry for.&nbsp; Mrs. Forester taxed me yesterday about the
<i>History of the Maids of Honour</i>; <a
name="citation308b"></a><a href="#footnote308b"
class="citation">[308b]</a> but I told her fairly it was no jest
of mine; for I found they did not relish it altogether well; and
I have enough already of a quarrel with that brute Sir John
Walter, who has been railing at me in all companies ever since I
dined with him; that I abused the Queen&rsquo;s meat and drink,
and said nothing at the table was good, and all a d&mdash;d lie;
for after dinner, commending the wine, I said I thought it was
something small.&nbsp; You would wonder how all my friends laugh
at this quarrel.&nbsp; It will be such a jest for the Keeper,
Treasurer, and Secretary.&mdash;I dined with honest Colonel
Godfrey, took a good walk of an <a name="page309"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 309</span>hour on the terrace, and then came
up to study; but it grows bloody cold, and I have no waistcoat
here.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I never dined with the chaplains till to-day; but my
friend Gastrell and the Dean of Rochester <a
name="citation309a"></a><a href="#footnote309a"
class="citation">[309a]</a> had often invited me, and I happened
to be disengaged: it is the worst provided table at Court.&nbsp;
We ate on pewter: every chaplain, when he is made a dean, gives a
piece of plate, and so they have got a little, some of it very
old.&nbsp; One who was made Dean of Peterborough (a small
deanery) said he would give no plate; he was only Dean of
Pewterborough.&nbsp; The news of Mr. Hill&rsquo;s miscarriage in
his expedition <a name="citation309b"></a><a href="#footnote309b"
class="citation">[309b]</a> came to-day, and I went to visit Mrs.
Masham and Mrs. Hill, his two sisters, to condole with
them.&nbsp; I advised them by all means to go to the
music-meeting to-night, to show they were not cast down, etc.,
and they thought my advice was right, and went.&nbsp; I doubt Mr.
Hill and his admiral made wrong steps; however, we lay it all to
a storm, etc.&nbsp; I sat with the Secretary at supper; then we
both went to Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s supper, and sat till
twelve.&nbsp; The Secretary is much mortified about Hill, because
this expedition was of his contriving, and he counted much upon
it; but Lord Treasurer was just as merry as usual, and old
laughing at Sir John Walter and me falling out.&nbsp; I said
nothing grieved me but that they would take example, and perhaps
presume upon it, and get out of my government; but that I thought
I was not obliged to govern bears, though I governed men.&nbsp;
They promise to be as obedient as ever, and so we laughed; and so
I go to bed; for it is colder still, and you have a fire now, and
are at cards at home.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Lord Harley and I dined privately to-day with Mrs.
Masham and Mrs. Hill, and my brother Masham.&nbsp; I saw Lord
Halifax at Court, and we joined and talked; and the Duchess of
Shrewsbury came up and reproached me for not dining with
her.&nbsp; I said that was not so soon done, for I expected more
advances from ladies, especially duchesses: she promised to
comply with any demands I pleased; and I agreed to dine with her
to-morrow, if I did not go to London <a name="page310"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>too soon, as I believe I shall
before dinner.&nbsp; Lady Oglethorpe brought me and the Duchess
of Hamilton <a name="citation310a"></a><a href="#footnote310a"
class="citation">[310a]</a> together to-day in the drawing-room,
and I have given her some encouragement, but not much.&nbsp;
Everybody has been teasing Walter.&nbsp; He told Lord Treasurer
that he took his company from him that were to dine with him: my
lord said, &ldquo;I will send you Dr. Swift:&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord
Keeper bid him take care what he did; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;Dr. Swift is not only all our favourite, but our
governor.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old company supped with Lord
Treasurer, and got away by twelve.</p>
<p>London, 8.&nbsp; I believe I shall go no more to Windsor, for
we expect the Queen will come in ten days to Hampton Court.&nbsp;
It was frost last night, and cruel cold to-day.&nbsp; I could not
dine with the Duchess, for I left Windsor half an hour after one
with Lord Treasurer, and we called at Kensington, where Mrs.
Masham was got to see her children for two days.&nbsp; I dined,
or rather supped, with Lord Treasurer, and stayed till after
ten.&nbsp; Tisdall <a name="citation310b"></a><a
href="#footnote310b" class="citation">[310b]</a> and his family
are gone from hence, upon some wrangle with the family.&nbsp;
Yesterday I had two letters brought me to Mr. Masham&rsquo;s; one
from Ford, and t&rsquo;other from our little MD, N. 21.&nbsp; I
would not tell you till to-day, because I would not.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t answer it till the next, because I have slipped two
days by being at Windsor, which I must recover here.&nbsp; Well,
sirrahs, I must go to sleep.&nbsp; The roads were as dry as at
midsummer to-day.&nbsp; This letter shall go to-morrow.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; It rains hard this morning.&nbsp; I
suppose our fair weather is now at an end.&nbsp; I think
I&rsquo;ll put on my waistcoat to-day: shall I?&nbsp; Well, I
will then, to please MD.&nbsp; I think of dining at home to-day
upon a chop and a pot.&nbsp; The town continues yet very
thin.&nbsp; Lord Strafford is gone to Holland, to tell them what
we have done here toward a peace.&nbsp; We shall soon hear what
the Dutch say, and how they take it.&nbsp; My humble service to
Mrs. Walls, Mrs. Stoyte, and Catherine.&mdash;Morrow, dearest
sirrahs, and farewell; and God Almighty bless MD, poor little
dear MD, for so I mean, <a name="page311"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 311</span>and Presto too.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
write to you again to-night, that is, I&rsquo;ll begin my next
letter.&nbsp; Farewell, etc.</p>
<p>This little bit belongs to MD; we must always write on the
margin: <a name="citation311a"></a><a href="#footnote311a"
class="citation">[311a]</a> you are saucy rogues.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXXII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Oct.</i> 9, 1711.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> forced to lie down at twelve
to-day, and mend my night&rsquo;s sleep: I slept till after two,
and then sent for a bit of mutton and pot of ale from the next
cook&rsquo;s shop, and had no stomach.&nbsp; I went out at four,
and called to see Biddy Floyd, which I had not done these three
months: she is something marked, but has recovered her complexion
quite, and looks very well.&nbsp; Then I sat the evening with
Mrs. Vanhomrigh, and drank coffee, and ate an egg.&nbsp; I
likewise took a new lodging to-day, not liking a ground-floor,
nor the ill smell, and other circumstances.&nbsp; I lodge, or
shall lodge, by Leicester Fields, and pay ten shillings a week;
that won&rsquo;t hold out long, faith.&nbsp; I shall lie here but
one night more.&nbsp; It rained terribly till one o&rsquo;clock
to-day.&nbsp; I lie, for I shall lie here two nights, till
Thursday, and then remove.&nbsp; Did I tell you that my friend
Mrs. Barton has a brother <a name="citation311b"></a><a
href="#footnote311b" class="citation">[311b]</a> drowned, that
went on the expedition with Jack Hill?&nbsp; He was a
lieutenant-colonel, and a coxcomb; and she keeps her chamber in
form, and the servants say she receives no messages.&mdash;Answer
MD&rsquo;s letter, Presto, d&rsquo;ye hear?&nbsp; No, says
Presto, I won&rsquo;t yet, I&rsquo;m busy; you&rsquo;re a saucy
rogue.&nbsp; Who talks?</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; It cost me two shillings in coach-hire to dine in
the City with a printer.&nbsp; I have sent, and caused to be
sent, three pamphlets out in a fortnight.&nbsp; I will ply the
rogues warm; and whenever anything of theirs makes a noise, it
shall have an answer.&nbsp; I have instructed an under
spur-leather to write <a name="page312"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 312</span>so, that it is taken for mine.&nbsp;
A rogue that writes a newspaper, called <i>The Protestant
Postboy</i>, has reflected on me in one of his papers; but the
Secretary has taken him up, and he shall have a squeeze
extraordinary.&nbsp; He says that an ambitious tantivy, <a
name="citation312a"></a><a href="#footnote312a"
class="citation">[312a]</a> missing of his towering hopes of
preferment in Ireland, is come over to vent his spleen on the
late Ministry, etc.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tantivy him with a
vengeance.&nbsp; I sat the evening at home, and am very busy, and
can hardly find time to write, unless it were to MD.&nbsp; I am
in furious haste.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord Treasurer.&nbsp; Thursdays
are now his days when his choice company comes, but we are too
much multiplied.&nbsp; George Granville sent his excuses upon
being ill; I hear he apprehends the apoplexy, which would grieve
me much.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer calls Prior nothing but Monsieur
Baudrier, which was the feigned name of the Frenchman that writ
his <i>Journey to Paris</i>. <a name="citation312b"></a><a
href="#footnote312b" class="citation">[312b]</a>&nbsp; They
pretend to suspect me, so I talk freely of it, and put them out
of their play.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer calls me now Dr. Martin,
because martin <a name="citation312c"></a><a href="#footnote312c"
class="citation">[312c]</a> is a sort of a swallow, and so is a
swift.&nbsp; When he and I came last Monday from Windsor, we were
reading all the signs on the road. <a name="citation312d"></a><a
href="#footnote312d" class="citation">[312d]</a>&nbsp; He is a
pure trifler; tell the Bishop of Clogher so.&nbsp; I made him
make two lines in verse for the Bell and Dragon, and they were
rare bad ones.&nbsp; I suppose Dilly is with you by this time:
what could his reason be of leaving London, and not owning
it?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas plaguy silly.&nbsp; I believe his natural
inconstancy made him weary.&nbsp; I think he is the king of
inconstancy.&nbsp; I stayed with Lord Treasurer till ten; we had
five lords and three commoners.&nbsp; Go to ombre, sirrahs.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; Mrs. Vanhomrigh has changed her lodging as well as
I.&nbsp; She found she had got with a bawd, and removed.&nbsp; I
<a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>dined
with her to-day; for though she boards, her landlady does not
dine with her.&nbsp; I am grown a mighty lover of herrings; but
they are much smaller here than with you.&nbsp; In the afternoon
I visited an old major-general, and ate six oysters; then sat an
hour with Mrs. Colledge, <a name="citation313a"></a><a
href="#footnote313a" class="citation">[313a]</a> the
joiner&rsquo;s daughter that was hanged; it was the joiner was
hanged, and not his daughter; with Thompson&rsquo;s wife, a
magistrate.&nbsp; There was the famous Mrs. Floyd of Chester,
who, I think, is the handsomest woman (except MD) that ever I
saw.&nbsp; She told me that twenty people had sent her the verses
upon Biddy, <a name="citation313b"></a><a href="#footnote313b"
class="citation">[313b]</a> as meant to her: and, indeed, in
point of handsomeness, she deserves them much better.&nbsp; I
will not go to Windsor to-morrow, and so I told the Secretary
to-day.&nbsp; I hate the thoughts of Saturday and Sunday suppers
with Lord Treasurer.&nbsp; Jack Hill is come home from his
unfortunate expedition, and is, I think, now at Windsor: I have
not yet seen him.&nbsp; He is privately blamed by his own friends
for want of conduct.&nbsp; He called a council of war, and
therein it was determined to come back.&nbsp; But they say a
general should not do that, because the officers will always give
their opinion for returning, since the blame will not lie upon
them, but the general.&nbsp; I pity him heartily.&nbsp; Bernage
received his commission to-day.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Colonel Crowe, <a
name="citation313c"></a><a href="#footnote313c"
class="citation">[313c]</a> late Governor of Barbadoes; he is a
great acquaintance of your friend Sterne, to whom I trusted the
box.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer has refused Sterne&rsquo;s business,
and I doubt he is a rake; Jemmy Leigh stays for him, and nobody
knows where to find him.&nbsp; I am so busy now I have hardly
time to spare to write to our little MD, but in a fortnight I
hope it will be over.&nbsp; I am going now to be busy, etc.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; I was going to dine with Dr. Cockburn, but Sir
Andrew Fountaine met me, and carried me to Mrs. Van&rsquo;s,
where I drank the last bottle of Raymond&rsquo;s wine, admirable
good, better than any I get among the Ministry.&nbsp; I must pick
up time to answer this letter of MD&rsquo;s; I&rsquo;ll do it in
a day or two <a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>for certain.&mdash;I am glad I am not at Windsor, for
it is very cold, and I won&rsquo;t have a fire till
November.&nbsp; I am contriving how to stop up my grate with
bricks.&nbsp; Patrick was drunk last night; but did not come to
me, else I should have given him t&rsquo;other cuff.&nbsp; I sat
this evening with Mrs. Barton; it is the first day of her seeing
company; but I made her merry enough, and we were three hours
disputing upon Whig and Tory.&nbsp; She grieved for her brother
only for form, and he was a sad dog.&nbsp; Is Stella well enough
to go to church, pray? no numbings left? no darkness in your
eyes? do you walk and exercise?&nbsp; Your exercise is
ombre.&mdash;People are coming up to town: the Queen will be at
Hampton Court in a week.&nbsp; Lady Betty Germaine, I hear, is
come; and Lord Pembroke is coming: his wife <a
name="citation314a"></a><a href="#footnote314a"
class="citation">[314a]</a> is as big with child as she can
tumble.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; I sat at home till four this afternoon to-day
writing, and ate a roll and butter; then visited Will Congreve an
hour or two, and supped with Lord Treasurer, who came from
Windsor to-day, and brought Prior with him.&nbsp; The Queen has
thanked Prior for his good service in France, and promised to
make him a Commissioner of the Customs.&nbsp; Several of that
Commission are to be out; among the rest, my friend Sir Matthew
Dudley.&nbsp; I can do nothing for him, he is so hated by the
Ministry.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer kept me till twelve, so I need not
tell you it is now late.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Mr. Secretary at Dr.
Coatesworth&rsquo;s, <a name="citation314b"></a><a
href="#footnote314b" class="citation">[314b]</a> where he now
lodges till his house be got ready in Golden Square.&nbsp; One
Boyer, <a name="citation314c"></a><a href="#footnote314c"
class="citation">[314c]</a> a French dog, has abused me in a
pamphlet, and I have got him up in a messenger&rsquo;s hands: <a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>the
Secretary promises me to swinge him.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer told me
last night that he had the honour to be abused with me in a
pamphlet.&nbsp; I must make that rogue an example, for warning to
others.&nbsp; I was to see Jack Hill this morning, who made that
unfortunate expedition; and there is still more misfortune; for
that ship, which was admiral of his fleet, <a
name="citation315a"></a><a href="#footnote315a"
class="citation">[315a]</a> is blown up in the Thames, by an
accident and carelessness of some rogue, who was going, as they
think, to steal some gunpowder: five hundred men are lost.&nbsp;
We don&rsquo;t yet know the particulars.&nbsp; I am got home by
seven, and am going to be busy, and you are going to play and
supper; you live ten times happier than I; but I should live ten
times happier than you if I were with MD.&nbsp; I saw Jemmy Leigh
to-day in the street, who tells me that Sterne has not lain above
once these three weeks in his lodgings, and he doubts he takes
ill courses; he stays only till he can find Sterne to go along
with him, and he cannot hear of him.&nbsp; I begged him to
inquire about the box when he comes to Chester, which he
promises.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; The Secretary and I dined to-day with Brigadier
Britton, <a name="citation315b"></a><a href="#footnote315b"
class="citation">[315b]</a> a great friend of his.&nbsp; The lady
of the house is very gallant, about thirty-five; she is said to
have a great deal of wit; but I see nothing among any of them
that equals MD by a bar&rsquo;s length, as hope saved.&nbsp; My
Lord Treasurer is much out of order; he has a sore throat, and
the gravel, and a pain in his breast where the wound was: pray
God preserve him.&nbsp; The Queen comes to Hampton Court on
Tuesday next; people are coming fast to town, and I must answer
MD&rsquo;s letter, which I can hardly find time to do, though I
am at home the greatest part of the day.&nbsp; Lady Betty
Germaine and I were disputing Whig and Tory to death this
morning.&nbsp; She is grown very fat, and <a
name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>looks
mighty well.&nbsp; Biddy Floyd was there, and she is, I think,
very much spoiled with the smallpox.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer is still out of order, and that
breaks our method of dining there to-day.&nbsp; He is often
subject to a sore throat, and some time or other it will kill
him, unless he takes more care than he is apt to do.&nbsp; It was
said about the town that poor Lord Peterborow was dead at
Frankfort; but he is something better, and the Queen is sending
him to Italy, where I hope the warm climate will recover him: he
has abundance of excellent qualities, and we love one another
mightily.&nbsp; I was this afternoon in the City, ate a bit of
meat, and settled some things with a printer.&nbsp; I will answer
your letter on Saturday, if possible, and then send away this; so
to fetch up the odd days I lost at Windsor, and keep constant to
my fortnight.&nbsp; Ombre time is now coming on, and we shall
have nothing but Manley, and Walls, and Stoytes, and the
Dean.&nbsp; Have you got no new acquaintance?&nbsp; Poor girls;
nobody knows MD&rsquo;s good qualities.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis very
cold; but I will not have a fire till November, that&rsquo;s
pozz.&mdash;Well, but coming home to-night, I found on my table a
letter from MD; faith, I was angry, that is, with myself; and I
was afraid too to see MD&rsquo;s hand so soon, for fear of
something, I don&rsquo;t know what: at last I opened it, and it
was over well, and a bill for the two hundred guineas.&nbsp;
However, &rsquo;tis a sad thing that this letter is not gone, nor
your twenty-first answered yet.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; I was invited to-day to dine with Mrs. Van, with
some company who did not come; but I ate nothing but herrings;
you must know I hardly ever eat of above one thing, and that the
plainest ordinary meat at table; I love it best, and believe it
wholesomest.&nbsp; You love rarities; yes you do; I wish you had
all that I ever see where I go.&nbsp; I was coming home early,
and met the Secretary in his chair, who persuaded me to go with
him to Britton&rsquo;s; for he said he had been all day at
business, and had eaten nothing.&nbsp; So I went, and the time
passed so, that we stayed till two, so you may believe &rsquo;tis
late enough.</p>
<p><a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
317</span>20.&nbsp; This day has gone all wrong, by sitting up so
late last night.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer is not yet well, and
can&rsquo;t go to Windsor.&nbsp; I dined with Sir Matthew Dudley,
and took occasion to hint to him that he would lose his
employment, for which I am very sorry.&nbsp; Lord Pembroke and
his family are all come to town.&nbsp; I was kept so long at a
friend&rsquo;s this evening that I cannot send this
to-night.&nbsp; When I knocked at my lodgings, a fellow asked me
where lodged Dr. Swift?&nbsp; I told him I was the person: he
gave me a letter he brought from the Secretary&rsquo;s office,
and I gave him a shilling: when I came up, I saw Dingley&rsquo;s
hand: faith, I was afraid, I do not know what.&nbsp; At last it
was a formal letter, from Dingley about her exchequer
business.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll do it on Monday, and settle it
with Tooke.&nbsp; And now, boys, for your letter, I mean the
first, N. 21.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see; come out, little
letter.&nbsp; I never had the letter from the Bishop that Raymond
mentions; but I have written to Ned Southwell, to desire the Duke
of Ormond to speak to his reverence, that he may leave off his
impertinence.&nbsp; What a pox can they think I am doing for the
Archbishop here?&nbsp; You have a pretty notion of me in Ireland,
to make me an agent for the Archbishop of Dublin.&mdash;Why! do
you think I value your people&rsquo;s ingratitude about my part
in serving them?&nbsp; I remit them their first-fruits of
ingratitude, as freely as I got the other remitted to them.&nbsp;
The Lord Treasurer defers writing his letter to them, or else
they would be plaguily confounded by this time.&nbsp; For he
designs to give the merit of it wholly to the Queen and me, and
to let them know it was done before the Duke of Ormond was Lord
Lieutenant.&nbsp; You visit, you dine abroad, you see friends;
you pilgarlick; <a name="citation317a"></a><a
href="#footnote317a" class="citation">[317a]</a> you walk from
Finglas, you a cat&rsquo;s foot.&nbsp; O Lord&mdash;Lady Gore <a
name="citation317b"></a><a href="#footnote317b"
class="citation">[317b]</a> hung her child by the <i>waist</i>;
<a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>what is
that waist? <a name="citation318"></a><a href="#footnote318"
class="citation">[318]</a>&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand that
word; he must hang on till you explain or spell it.&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t believe he was pretty, that&rsquo;s a
liiii.&mdash;Pish! burn your First-Fruits; again at it.&nbsp;
Stella has made twenty false spellings in her writing; I&rsquo;ll
send them to you all back again on the other side of this letter,
to mend them; I won&rsquo;t miss one.&nbsp; Why, I think there
were seventeen bishops&rsquo; names to the letter Lord Oxford
received.&mdash;I will send you some pamphlets by Leigh; put me
in mind of it on Monday, for I shall go then to the printer; yes,
and the <i>Miscellany</i>.&nbsp; I am mightily obliged to Walls,
but I don&rsquo;t deserve it by any usage of him here, having
seen him but twice, and once en passant.&nbsp; Mrs. Manley
forsworn ombre!&nbsp; What! and no blazing star appear? no
monsters born? no whale thrown up? have you not found out some
evasion for her?&nbsp; She had no such regard to oaths in her
younger days.&nbsp; I got the books for nothing, Madam Dingley;
but the wine I got not; it was but a promise.&mdash;Yes, my head
is pretty well in the main, only now and then a little
threatening or so.&mdash;You talk of my reconciling some great
folks.&nbsp; I tell you what.&nbsp; The Secretary told me last
night that he had found the reason why the Queen was cold to him
for some months past; that a friend had told it him yesterday;
and it was, that they suspected he was at the bottom with the
Duke of Marlborough.&nbsp; Then he said he had reflected upon all
I had spoken to him long ago, but he thought it had only been my
suspicion, and my zeal and kindness for him.&nbsp; I said I had
reason to take that very ill, to imagine I knew so little of the
world as to talk at a venture to a great Minister; that I had
gone between him and Lord Treasurer often, and told each of them
what I had said to the other, and that I <a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>had
informed him so before.&nbsp; He said all that you may imagine to
excuse himself, and approve my conduct.&nbsp; I told him I knew
all along that this proceeding of mine was the surest way to send
me back to my willows in Ireland, but that I regarded it not,
provided I could do the kingdom service in keeping them well
together.&nbsp; I minded him how often I had told Lord Treasurer,
Lord Keeper, and him together, that all things depended on their
union, and that my comfort was to see them love one another; and
I had told them all singly that I had not said this by chance,
etc. He was in a rage to be thus suspected; swears he will be
upon a better foot, or none at all; and I do not see how they can
well want him in this juncture.&nbsp; I hope to find a way of
settling this matter.&nbsp; I act an honest part, that will bring
me neither honour nor praise.&nbsp; MD must think the better of
me for it: nobody else shall ever know of it.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
politics enough for once; but Madam DD gave me occasion for
it.&nbsp; I think I told you I have got into lodgings that
don&rsquo;t smell ill&mdash;O Lord! the spectacles: well,
I&rsquo;ll do that on Monday too; although it goes against me to
be employed for folks that neither you nor I care a groat
for.&nbsp; Is the eight pounds from Hawkshaw included in the
thirty-nine pounds five shillings and twopence?&nbsp; How do I
know by this how my account stands?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you write
five or six lines to cast it up?&nbsp; Mine is forty-four pounds
per annum, and eight pounds from Hawkshaw makes fifty-two
pounds.&nbsp; Pray set it right, and let me know; you had
best.&mdash;And so now I have answered N. 21, and &rsquo;tis
late, and I will answer N. 22 in my next: this cannot go
to-night, but shall on Tuesday: and so go to your play, and lose
your money, with your two eggs a penny; silly jade; you witty?
very pretty.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; Mrs. Van would have me dine with her again to-day,
and so I did, though Lady Mountjoy has sent two or three times to
have me see and dine with her, and she is a little body I love
very well.&nbsp; My head has ached a little in the evenings these
three or four days, but it is not of the <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>giddy sort,
so I do not much value it.&nbsp; I was to see Lord Harley to-day,
but Lord Treasurer took physic; and I could not see him.&nbsp; He
has voided much gravel, and is better, but not well: he talks of
going on Tuesday to see the Queen at Hampton Court; I wish he may
be able.&nbsp; I never saw so fine a summer day as this was: how
is it with you, pray? and can&rsquo;t you remember, naughty
packs?&nbsp; I han&rsquo;t seen Lord Pembroke yet.&nbsp; He will
be sorry to miss Dilly: I wonder you say nothing of Dilly&rsquo;s
being got to Ireland; if he be not there soon, I shall have some
certain odd thoughts: guess them if you can.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; I dined in the City to-day with Dr. Freind, at one
of my printers: I inquired for Leigh, but could not find him: I
have forgot what sort of apron you want.&nbsp; I must rout among
your letters, a needle in a bottle of hay.&nbsp; I gave Sterne
directions, but where to find him Lord knows.&nbsp; I have
bespoken the spectacles; got a set of <i>Examiners</i>, and five
pamphlets, which I have either written or contributed to, except
the best, which is the <i>Vindication of the Duke of
Marlborough</i>, and is entirely of the author of the
<i>Atalantis</i>. <a name="citation320"></a><a
href="#footnote320" class="citation">[320]</a>&nbsp; I have
settled Dingley&rsquo;s affair with Tooke, who has undertaken it,
and understands it.&nbsp; I have bespoken a <i>Miscellany</i>:
what would you have me do more?&nbsp; It cost me a shilling
coming home; it rains terribly, and did so in the morning.&nbsp;
Lord Treasurer has had an ill day, in much pain.&nbsp; He writes
and does business in his chamber now he is ill: the man is
bewitched: he desires to see me, and I&rsquo;ll maul him, but he
will not value it a rush.&nbsp; I am half weary of them
all.&nbsp; I often burst out into these thoughts, and will
certainly steal away as soon as I decently can.&nbsp; I have many
friends, and many enemies; and the last are more constant in
their nature.&nbsp; I have no shuddering at all to think of
retiring to my old circumstances, if you can be easy; but I will
always live in Ireland as I did the last time; I will not hunt
for dinners there, nor converse with more than a very few.</p>
<p><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>23.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; This goes to-day, and shall be
sealed by and by.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer takes physic again to-day:
I believe I shall dine with Lord Dupplin.&nbsp; Mr. Tooke brought
me a letter directed for me at Morphew&rsquo;s the
bookseller.&nbsp; I suppose, by the postage, it came from
Ireland.&nbsp; It is a woman&rsquo;s hand, and seems false spelt
on purpose: it is in such sort of verse as Harris&rsquo;s
petition; <a name="citation321a"></a><a href="#footnote321a"
class="citation">[321a]</a> rallies me for writing merry things,
and not upon divinity; and is like the subject of the
Archbishop&rsquo;s last letter, as I told you.&nbsp; Can you
guess whom it came from?&nbsp; It is not ill written; pray find
it out.&nbsp; There is a Latin verse at the end of it all rightly
spelt; yet the English, as I think, affectedly wrong in many
places.&nbsp; My plaguing time is coming.&nbsp; A young fellow
brought me a letter from Judge Coote, <a
name="citation321b"></a><a href="#footnote321b"
class="citation">[321b]</a> with recommendation to be lieutenant
of a man-of-war.&nbsp; He is the son of one Echlin, <a
name="citation321c"></a><a href="#footnote321c"
class="citation">[321c]</a> who was minister of Belfast before
Tisdall, and I have got some other new customers; but I shall
trouble my friends as little as possible.&nbsp; Saucy Stella used
to jeer me for meddling with other folks&rsquo; affairs; but now
I am punished for it.&mdash;Patrick has brought the candle, and I
have no more room.&nbsp; Farewell, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Here is a full and true account of Stella&rsquo;s new
spelling:&mdash;<a name="citation321d"></a><a

<p>Tell me truly, sirrah, how many of these are mistakes of the
pen, and how many are you to answer for as real ill
spelling?&nbsp; There are but fourteen; I said twenty by
guess.&nbsp; You must not be angry, for I will have you spell
right, let the world go how it will.&nbsp; Though, after all,
there is but a mistake of one letter in any of these words.&nbsp;
I allow you henceforth but six false spellings in every letter
you send me.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXXIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Oct.</i> 23, 1711.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">dined</span> with Lord Dupplin as I told
you I would, and put my thirty-second into the post-office my own
self; and I believe there has not been one moment since we parted
wherein a letter was not upon the road going or coming to or from
PMD.&nbsp; If the Queen knew it, she would give us a pension; for
it is we bring good luck to their post-boys and their packets;
else they would break their necks and sink.&nbsp; But, an old
saying and a true one:</p>
<p class="poetry">Be it snow, or storm, or hail,<br />
PMD&rsquo;s letters never fail;<br />
Cross winds may sometimes make them tarry,<br />
But PMD&rsquo;s letters can&rsquo;t miscarry.</p>
<p>Terrible rain to-day, but it cleared up at night enough to
save my twelvepence coming home.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer is much
better this evening.&nbsp; I hate to have him ill, he is so
confoundedly careless.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t answer your letter
yet, so be satisfied.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; I called at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s to-day at noon:
he was eating some broth in his bed-chamber, undressed, with a <a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>thousand
papers about him.&nbsp; He has a little fever upon him, and his
eye terribly bloodshot; yet he dressed himself and went out to
the Treasury.&nbsp; He told me he had a letter from a lady with a
complaint against me; it was from Mrs. Cutts, a sister of Lord
Cutts, who writ to him that I had abused her brother: <a
name="citation323a"></a><a href="#footnote323a"
class="citation">[323a]</a> you remember the
&ldquo;Salamander,&rdquo; it is printed in the
<i>Miscellany</i>.&nbsp; I told my lord that I would never regard
complaints, and that I expected, whenever he received any against
me, he would immediately put them into the fire, and forget them,
else I should have no quiet.&nbsp; I had a little turn in my head
this morning; which, though it did not last above a moment, yet
being of the true sort, has made me as weak as a dog all this
day.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the first I have had this half-year.&nbsp;
I shall take my pills if I hear of it again.&nbsp; I dined at
Lady Mountjoy&rsquo;s with Harry Coote, <a
name="citation323b"></a><a href="#footnote323b"
class="citation">[323b]</a> and went to see Lord Pembroke upon
his coming to town.&mdash;The Whig party are furious against a
peace, and every day some ballad comes out reflecting on the
Ministry on that account.&nbsp; The Secretary St. John has seized
on a dozen booksellers and publishers into his messengers&rsquo;
hands. <a name="citation323c"></a><a href="#footnote323c"
class="citation">[323c]</a>&nbsp; Some of the foreign Ministers
have published the preliminaries agreed on here between France
and England; and people rail at them as insufficient to treat a
peace upon; but the secret is, that the French have agreed to
articles much more important, which our Ministers have not
communicated, and the people, who think they know all, are
discontented that there is no more.&nbsp; This was an
inconvenience I foretold to the Secretary, but we could contrive
no way to fence against it.&nbsp; So there&rsquo;s politics for
you.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; The Queen is at Hampton Court: she went on Tuesday
in that terrible rain.&nbsp; I dined with Lewis at his <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>lodgings,
to despatch some business we had.&nbsp; I sent this morning and
evening to Lord Treasurer, and he is much worse by going out; I
am in pain about evening.&nbsp; He has sent for Dr. Radcliffe;
pray God preserve him.&nbsp; The Chancellor of the Exchequer <a
name="citation324a"></a><a href="#footnote324a"
class="citation">[324a]</a> showed me to-day a ballad <a
name="citation324b"></a><a href="#footnote324b"
class="citation">[324b]</a> in manuscript against Lord Treasurer
and his South Sea project; it is very sharply written: if it be
not printed, I will send it you.&nbsp; If it be, it shall go in
your packet of pamphlets.&mdash;I found out your letter about
directions for the apron, and have ordered to be bought a cheap
green silk work apron; I have it by heart.&nbsp; I sat this
evening with Mrs. Barton, who is my near neighbour.&nbsp; It was
a delicious day, and I got my walk, and was thinking whether MD
was walking too just at that time that Presto was. This paper
does not cost me a farthing, I have it from the Secretary&rsquo;s
office.&nbsp; I long till to-morrow to know how my Lord Treasurer
sleeps this night, and to hear he mends: we are all undone
without him; so pray for him, sirrahs, and don&rsquo;t stay too
late at the Dean&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; I dined with Mrs. Van; for the weather is so bad,
and I am so busy, that I can&rsquo;t dine with great folks: and
besides I dare eat but little, to keep my head in order, which is
better.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer is very ill, but I hope in no
danger.&nbsp; We have no quiet with the Whigs, they are so
violent against a peace; but I&rsquo;ll cool them, with a
vengeance, very soon.&nbsp; I have not heard from the Bishop of
Clogher, whether he has got his statues. <a
name="citation324c"></a><a href="#footnote324c"
class="citation">[324c]</a>&nbsp; I writ to him six weeks ago;
he&rsquo;s so busy with his Parliament.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
answer your letter yet, say what you will, saucy girls.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; I forgot to go about some business this morning,
which cost me double the time; and I was forced to be at the
Secretary&rsquo;s office till four, and lose my dinner; so I went
to Mrs. Van&rsquo;s, and made them get me three herrings, which I
am very fond of, and they are a light victuals: besides, I was <a
name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>to have
supped at Lady Ashburnham&rsquo;s; but the drab did not call for
us in her coach, as she promised, but sent for us, and so I sent
my excuses.&nbsp; It has been a terrible rainy day, but so
flattering in the morning, that I would needs go out in my new
hat.&nbsp; I met Leigh and Sterne as I was going into the
Park.&nbsp; Leigh says he will go to Ireland in ten days, if he
can get Sterne to go with him; so I will send him the things for
MD, and I have desired him to inquire about the box.&nbsp; I hate
that Sterne for his carelessness about it; but it was my
fault.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; I was all this terrible rainy day with my friend
Lewis upon business of importance; and I dined with him, and came
home about seven, and thought I would amuse myself a little,
after the pains I had taken.&nbsp; I saw a volume of
Congreve&rsquo;s plays in my room, that Patrick had taken to
read; and I looked into it, and in mere loitering read in it till
twelve, like an owl and a fool: if ever I do so again; never saw
the like.&nbsp; Count Gallas, <a name="citation325a"></a><a
href="#footnote325a" class="citation">[325a]</a> the
Emperor&rsquo;s Envoy, you will hear, is in disgrace with us: the
Queen has ordered her Ministers to have no more commerce with
him; the reason is, the fool writ a rude letter to Lord
Dartmouth, Secretary of State, complaining of our proceedings
about a peace; and he is always in close confidence with Lord
Wharton and Sunderland, and others of the late Ministry.&nbsp; I
believe you begin to think there will be no peace; the Whigs here
are sure it cannot be, and stocks are fallen again.&nbsp; But I
am confident there will, unless France plays us tricks; and you
may venture a wager with any of your Whig acquaintance that we
shall not have another campaign.&nbsp; You will get more by it
than by ombre, sirrah.&mdash;I let slip telling you
yesterday&rsquo;s journal, which I thought to have done this
morning, but blundered.&nbsp; I dined yesterday at Harry
Coote&rsquo;s, with Lord Hatton, <a name="citation325b"></a><a
href="#footnote325b" class="citation">[325b]</a> Mr. Finch, a son
of Lord Nottingham, <a name="page326"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 326</span>and Sir Andrew Fountaine.&nbsp; I
left them soon, but hear they stayed till two in the morning, and
were all drunk: and so good-night for last night, and good-night
for to-night.&nbsp; You blundering goosecap, an&rsquo;t you
ashamed to blunder to young ladies?&nbsp; I shall have a fire in
three or four days now, oh ho.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; I was to-day in the City concerting some things with
a printer, and am to be to-morrow all day busy with Mr. Secretary
about the same.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t tell you now; but the
Ministers reckon it will do abundance of good, and open the eyes
of the nation, who are half bewitched against a peace.&nbsp; Few
of this generation can remember anything but war and taxes, and
they think it is as it should be; whereas &rsquo;tis certain we
are the most undone people in Europe, as I am afraid I shall make
appear beyond all contradiction.&nbsp; But I forgot; I
won&rsquo;t tell you what I will do, nor what I will not do: so
let me alone, and go to Stoyte, and give Goody Stoyte and
Catherine my humble service; I love Goody Stoyte better than
Goody Walls.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;ll pay me for this green
apron?&nbsp; I will have the money; it cost ten shillings and
sixpence.&nbsp; I think it plaguy dear for a cheap thing; but
they said that English silk would cockle, <a
name="citation326a"></a><a href="#footnote326a"
class="citation">[326a]</a> and I know not what.&nbsp; You have
the making into the bargain.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis right Italian: I
have sent it and the pamphlets to Leigh, and will send the
<i>Miscellanies</i> and spectacles in a day or two.&nbsp; I would
send more; but, faith, I&rsquo;m plaguy poor at present.</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; The devil&rsquo;s in this Secretary: when I went
this morning he had people with him; but says he, &ldquo;we are
to dine with Prior to-day, and then will do all our business in
the afternoon&rdquo;: at two, Prior sends word he is otherwise
engaged; then the Secretary and I go and dine with Brigadier
Britton, sit till eight, grow merry, no business done; he is in
haste to see Lady Jersey; <a name="citation326b"></a><a
href="#footnote326b" class="citation">[326b]</a> we part, and
appoint no time to meet <a name="page327"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 327</span>again.&nbsp; This is the fault of
all the present Ministers, teasing me to death for my assistance,
laying the whole weight of their affairs upon it, yet slipping
opportunities.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer mends every day, though
slowly: I hope he will take care of himself.&nbsp; Pray, will you
send to Parvisol to send me a bill of twenty pounds as soon as he
can, for I want money.&nbsp; I must have money; I will have
money, sirrahs.</p>
<p>Nov. 1.&nbsp; I went to-day into the City to settle some
business with Stratford, and to dine with him; but he was
engaged, and I was so angry I would not dine with any other
merchant, but went to my printer, and ate a bit, and did business
of mischief with him, and I shall have the spectacles and
<i>Miscellany</i> to-morrow, and leave them with Leigh.&nbsp; A
fine day always makes me go into the City, if I can spare time,
because it is exercise; and that does me more good than
anything.&nbsp; I have heard nothing since of my head, but a
little, I don&rsquo;t know how, sometimes: but I am very
temperate, especially now the Treasurer is ill, and the Ministers
often at Hampton Court, and the Secretary not yet fixed in his
house, and I hate dining with many of my old acquaintance.&nbsp;
Here has been a fellow discovered going out of the East India
House with sixteen thousand pounds in money and bills; he would
have escaped, if he had not been so uneasy with thirst, that he
stole out before his time, and was caught.&nbsp; But what is that
to MD?&nbsp; I wish we had the money, provided the East India
Company was never the worse; you know we must not covet,
etc.&nbsp; Our weather, for this fortnight past, is chequered, a
fair and a rainy day: this was very fine, and I have walked four
miles; wish MD would do so, lazy sluttikins.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It has rained all day with a continuendo, and I went
in a chair to dine with Mrs. Van; always there in a very rainy
day.&nbsp; But I made a shift to come back afoot.&nbsp; I live a
very retired life, pay very few visits, and keep but very little
<a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>company;
I read no newspapers.&nbsp; I am sorry I sent you the
<i>Examiner</i>, for the printer is going to print them in a
small volume: it seems the author is too proud to have them
printed by subscription, though his friends offered, they say, to
make it worth five hundred pounds to him.&nbsp; The
<i>Spectators</i> are likewise printing in a larger and a smaller
volume, so I believe they are going to leave them off, and indeed
people grow weary of them, though they are often prettily
written.&nbsp; We have had no news for me to send you now towards
the end of my letter.&nbsp; The Queen has the gout a little: I
hoped the Lord Treasurer would have had it too, but Radcliffe
told me yesterday it was the rheumatism in his knee and foot;
however, he mends, and I hope will be abroad in a short
time.&nbsp; I am told they design giving away several employments
before the Parliament sits, which will be the thirteenth
instant.&nbsp; I either do not like, or not understand this
policy; and if Lord Treasurer does not mend soon, they must give
them just before the session.&nbsp; But he is the greatest
procrastinator in the world.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; A fine day this, and I walked a pretty deal.&nbsp; I
stuffed the Secretary&rsquo;s pockets with papers, which he must
read and settle at Hampton Court, where he went to-day, and stays
some time.&nbsp; They have no lodgings for me there, so I
can&rsquo;t go, for the town is small, chargeable, and
inconvenient.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer had a very ill night last
night, with much pain in his knee and foot, but is easier
to-day.&mdash;And so I went to visit Prior about some business,
and so he was not within, and so Sir Andrew Fountaine made me
dine to-day again with Mrs. Van, and I came home soon,
remembering this must go to-night, and that I had a letter of
MD&rsquo;s to answer.&nbsp; O Lord, where is it? let me see; so,
so, here it is.&nbsp; You grudge writing so soon.&nbsp; Pox on
that bill! the woman would have me manage that money for
her.&nbsp; I do not know what to do with it now I have it: I am
like the unprofitable steward in the Gospel: I laid it up in a
napkin; there thou hast what is thine own, etc.&nbsp; Well, well,
I know of your new Mayor.&nbsp; (I&rsquo;ll tell you a pun: a
fishmonger owed a man two <a name="page329"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 329</span>crowns; so he sent him a piece of
bad ling and a tench, and then said he was paid: how is that now?
find it out; for I won&rsquo;t tell it you: which of you finds it
out?)&nbsp; Well, but as I was saying, what care I for your
Mayor?&nbsp; I fancy Ford may tell Forbes right about my
returning to Ireland before Christmas, or soon after.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sorry you did not go on with your story about Pray God
you be John; I never heard it in my life, and wonder what it can
be.&mdash;Ah, Stella, faith, you leaned upon your Bible to think
what to say when you writ that.&nbsp; Yes, that story of the
Secretary&rsquo;s making me an example is true; &ldquo;never
heard it before;&rdquo; why, how could you hear it? is it
possible to tell you the hundredth part of what passes in our
companies here?&nbsp; The Secretary is as easy with me as Mr.
Addison was.&nbsp; I have often thought what a splutter Sir
William Temple makes about being Secretary of State: <a
name="citation329a"></a><a href="#footnote329a"
class="citation">[329a]</a> I think Mr. St. John the greatest
young man I ever knew; wit, capacity, beauty, quickness of
apprehension, good learning, and an excellent taste; the best
orator in the House of Commons, admirable conversation, good
nature, and good manners; generous, and a despiser of
money.&nbsp; His only fault is talking to his friends in way of
complaint of too great a load of business, which looks a little
like affectation; and he endeavours too much to mix the fine
gentleman and man of pleasure with the man of business.&nbsp;
What truth and sincerity he may have I know not: he is now but
thirty-two, and has been Secretary above a year.&nbsp; Is not all
this extraordinary? how he stands with the Queen and Lord
Treasurer I have told you before.&nbsp; This is his character;
and I believe you will be diverted by knowing it.&nbsp; I writ to
the Archbishop of Dublin, Bishop of Cloyne <a
name="citation329b"></a><a href="#footnote329b"
class="citation">[329b]</a> and of Clogher together, five weeks
ago from Windsor: I hope they had my letters; pray know if
Clogher had his.&mdash;Fig for your physician and his advice,
Madam Dingley: if I grow worse, I will; otherwise I will trust to
temperance and exercise: your fall of the leaf; what care I when
the leaves fall?&nbsp; I am sorry to see them fall with all <a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>my heart;
but why should I take physic because leaves fall off from trees?
that won&rsquo;t hinder them from falling.&nbsp; If a man falls
from a horse, must I take physic for that?&mdash;This arguing
makes you mad; but it is true right reason, not to be
disproved.&mdash;I am glad at heart to hear poor Stella is
better; use exercise and walk, spend pattens and spare potions,
wear out clogs and waste claret.&nbsp; Have you found out my pun
of the fishmonger? don&rsquo;t read a word more till you have got
it.&nbsp; And Stella is handsome again, you say? and is she
fat?&nbsp; I have sent to Leigh the set of <i>Examiners</i>: the
first thirteen were written by several hands, some good, some
bad; the next three-and-thirty were all by one hand, that makes
forty-six: then that author, <a name="citation330a"></a><a
href="#footnote330a" class="citation">[330a]</a> whoever he was,
laid it down on purpose to confound guessers; and the last six
were written by a woman. <a name="citation330b"></a><a
href="#footnote330b" class="citation">[330b]</a>&nbsp; Then there
is an account of Guiscard by the same woman, but the facts sent
by Presto.&nbsp; Then an answer to the letter to the Lords about
Gregg by Presto; Prior&rsquo;s <i>Journey</i> by Presto;
<i>Vindication of the Duke of Marlborough</i>, entirely by the
same woman; Comment on Hare&rsquo;s Sermon by the same woman,
only hints sent to the printer from Presto to give her. <a
name="citation330c"></a><a href="#footnote330c"
class="citation">[330c]</a>&nbsp; Then there&rsquo;s the
<i>Miscellany</i>, an apron for Stella, a pound of chocolate,
without sugar, for Stella, a fine snuff-rasp of ivory, given me
by Mrs. St. John for Dingley, and a large roll of tobacco, which
she must hide or cut shorter out of modesty, and four pair of
spectacles for the Lord knows who.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the cargo,
I hope it will come safe.&nbsp; Oh, Mrs. Masham and I are very
well; we write to one another, but it is upon business; I believe
I told you so before: pray pardon my forgetfulness in these
cases; poor Presto can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; MD shall have the
money as soon as Tooke gets it.&nbsp; And so I think I have
answered all, and the paper is out, and now I have fetched up my
week, and will send you another this <a name="page331"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 331</span>day fortnight.&mdash;Why, you
rogues, two crowns make <i>tench-ill-ling</i>: <a
name="citation331"></a><a href="#footnote331"
class="citation">[331]</a> you are so dull you could never have
found it out.&nbsp; Farewell, etc. etc.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXXIV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Nov.</i> 3, 1711.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> thirty-third lies now before me
just finished, and I am going to seal and send it, so let me know
whether you would have me add anything: I gave you my journal of
this day; and it is now nine at night, and I am going to be busy
for an hour or two.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I left a friend&rsquo;s house to-day where I was
invited, just when dinner was setting on, and pretended I was
engaged, because I saw some fellows I did not know; and went to
Sir Matthew Dudley&rsquo;s, where I had the same inconvenience,
but he would not let me go; otherwise I would have gone home, and
sent for a slice of mutton and a pot of ale, rather than dine
with persons unknown, as bad, for aught I know, as your deans,
parsons, and curates.&nbsp; Bad slabby weather to-day.&mdash;Now
methinks I write at ease, when I have no letter of MD&rsquo;s to
answer.&nbsp; But I mistook, and have got the large paper.&nbsp;
The Queen is laid up with the gout at Hampton Court: she is now
seldom without it any long time together; I fear it will wear her
out in a very few years.&nbsp; I plainly find I have less
twitchings about my toes since these Ministers are sick and out
of town, and that I don&rsquo;t dine with them.&nbsp; I would
compound for a light easy gout to be perfectly well in my
head.&mdash;Pray walk when the frost comes, young ladies go a
frost-biting.&nbsp; It comes into my head, that, from the very
time you first went to Ireland, I have been always plying you to
walk and read.&nbsp; The young fellows here have begun a kind of
fashion to walk, and many of them have got swingeing strong shoes
on purpose; it has got as far as several young lords; if it hold,
it would be a very good thing.&nbsp; Lady <a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>Lucy <a
name="citation332a"></a><a href="#footnote332a"
class="citation">[332a]</a> and I are fallen out; she rails at
me, and I have left visiting her.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; MD was very troublesome to me last night in my sleep;
I was a dreamed, methought, that Stella was here.&nbsp; I asked
her after Dingley, and she said she had left her in Ireland,
because she designed her stay to be short, and such
stuff.&mdash;Monsieur Pontchartain, the Secretary of State in
France, and Monsieur Fontenelle, the Secretary of the Royal
Academy there (who writ the <i>Dialogues des Morts</i>, etc.),
have sent letters to Lord Pembroke that the Academy have, with
the King&rsquo;s consent, chosen him one of their members in the
room of one who is lately dead.&nbsp; But the cautious gentleman
has given me the letters to show my Lord Dartmouth and Mr. St.
John, our two Secretaries, and let them see there is no treason
in them; which I will do on Wednesday, when they come from
Hampton Court.&nbsp; The letters are very handsome, and it is a
very great mark of honour and distinction to Lord Pembroke.&nbsp;
I hear the two French Ministers are come over again about the
peace; but I have seen nobody of consequence to know the
truth.&nbsp; I dined to-day with a lady of my acquaintance, who
was sick, in her bed-chamber, upon three herrings and a chicken:
the dinner was my bespeaking.&nbsp; We begin now to have
chestnuts and Seville oranges; have you the latter yet?&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas a terrible windy day, and we had processions in carts
of the Pope and the Devil, and the butchers rang their
cleavers.&nbsp; You know this is the Fifth of November, Popery
and gunpowder.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Since I am used to this way of writing, I fancy I
could hardly make out a long letter to MD without it.&nbsp; I
think I ought to allow for every line taken up by telling you
where I dined; but that will not be above seven lines in all,
half a line to a dinner.&nbsp; Your Ingoldsby <a
name="citation332b"></a><a href="#footnote332b"
class="citation">[332b]</a> is going over, and they say here he
is to be made a lord.&mdash;Here was I staying in my room till
two this afternoon for that puppy Sir Andrew Fountaine, who was
to go with me into the City, and never came; and if I had not
shot a dinner flying, with one Mr. <a name="page333"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 333</span>Murray, I might have fasted, or gone
to an alehouse.&mdash;You never said one word of Goody Stoyte in
your letter; but I suppose these winter nights we shall hear more
of her.&nbsp; Does the Provost <a name="citation333a"></a><a
href="#footnote333a" class="citation">[333a]</a> laugh as much as
he used to do?&nbsp; We reckon him here a good-for-nothing
fellow.&mdash;I design to write to your Dean one of these days,
but I can never find time, nor what to say.&mdash;I will think of
something: but if DD <a name="citation333b"></a><a
href="#footnote333b" class="citation">[333b]</a> were not in
Ireland I believe seriously I should not think of the place twice
a year.&nbsp; Nothing there ever makes the subject of talk in any
company where I am.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; I went to-day to the City on business; but stopped at
a printer&rsquo;s, and stayed there: it was a most delicious
day.&nbsp; I hear the Parliament is to be prorogued for a
fortnight longer; I suppose, either because the Queen has the
gout, or that Lord Treasurer is not well, or that they would do
something more towards a peace.&nbsp; I called at Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s at noon, and sat a while with Lord Harley, but
his father was asleep.&nbsp; A bookseller has reprinted or
new-titled a sermon of Tom Swift&rsquo;s, <a
name="citation333c"></a><a href="#footnote333c"
class="citation">[333c]</a> printed last year, and publishes an
advertisement calling it <i>Dr. Swift&rsquo;s Sermon</i>.&nbsp;
Some friend of Lord Galway <a name="citation333d"></a><a
href="#footnote333d" class="citation">[333d]</a> has, by his
directions, published a four-shilling book about his conduct in
Spain, to defend him; I have but just seen it.&nbsp; But what
care you for books, except Presto&rsquo;s
<i>Miscellanies</i>?&nbsp; Leigh promised to call and see me, but
has not yet; I hope he will take care of his cargo, and get your
Chester box.&nbsp; A murrain take that box! everything is spoiled
that is in it.&nbsp; How does the strong box do?&nbsp; You say
nothing of Raymond: is his wife brought to bed again; or how? has
he finished his house; paid his debts; and put out the rest of
the money to use?&nbsp; I am glad to hear poor Joe is like to get
his two hundred pounds.&nbsp; I suppose Trim is now reduced to
slavery again.&nbsp; I am glad of it; the people were as great
rascals as <a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
334</span>the gentlemen.&nbsp; But I must go to bed, sirrahs: the
Secretary is still at Hampton Court with my papers, or is come
only to-night.&nbsp; They plague me with attending them.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; I was with the Secretary this morning, and we dined
with Prior, and did business this afternoon till about eight; and
I must alter and undo, and a clutter.&nbsp; I am glad the
Parliament is prorogued.&nbsp; I stayed with Prior till eleven;
the Secretary left us at eight.&nbsp; Prior, I believe, will be
one of those employed to make the peace, when a Congress is
opened.&nbsp; Lord Ashburnham told to-day at the Coffee-house
that Lord Harley <a name="citation334a"></a><a
href="#footnote334a" class="citation">[334a]</a> was yesterday
morning married to the Duke of Newcastle&rsquo;s daughter, the
great heiress, and it got about all the town.&nbsp; But I saw
Lord Harley yesterday at noon in his nightgown, and he dined in
the City with Prior and others; so it is not true; but I hope it
will be so; for I know it has been privately managing this long
time: <a name="citation334b"></a><a href="#footnote334b"
class="citation">[334b]</a> the lady will not have half her
father&rsquo;s estate; for the Duke left Lord Pelham&rsquo;s son
his heir. <a name="citation334c"></a><a href="#footnote334c"
class="citation">[334c]</a>&nbsp; The widow Duchess will not
stand to the will, and she is now at law with Pelham.&nbsp;
However, at worst, the girl will have about ten thousand pounds a
year to support the honour; for Lord Treasurer will never save a
groat for himself.&nbsp; Lord Harley is a very valuable young
gentleman; and they say the girl is handsome, and has good sense,
but red hair.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; I designed a jaunt into the City to-day to be merry,
but was disappointed; so one always is in this life; and I could
not see Lord Dartmouth to-day, with whom I had some
business.&nbsp; Business and pleasure both disappointed.&nbsp;
You can go to your Dean, and for want of him, Goody Stoyte, or
Walls, or Manley, and meet everywhere with cards and <a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>claret.&nbsp; I dined privately with a friend on a
herring and chicken, and half a flask of bad Florence.&nbsp; I
begin to have fires now, when the mornings are cold.&nbsp; I have
got some loose bricks at the back of my grate for good
husbandry.&nbsp; Fine weather.&nbsp; Patrick tells me my caps are
wearing out.&nbsp; I know not how to get others.&nbsp; I want a
necessary woman strangely.&nbsp; I am as helpless as an
elephant.&mdash;I had three packets from the Archbishop of
Dublin, cost me four shillings, all about Higgins, <a
name="citation335a"></a><a href="#footnote335a"
class="citation">[335a]</a> printed stuff, and two long
letters.&nbsp; His people forgot to enclose them to Lewis; and
they were only directed to Doctor Swift, without naming London or
anything else.&nbsp; I wonder how they reached me, unless the
postmaster directed them.&nbsp; I have read all the trash, and am
weary.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Why, if you must have it out, something is to be
published of great moment, <a name="citation335b"></a><a
href="#footnote335b" class="citation">[335b]</a> and three or
four great people are to see there are no mistakes in point of
fact: and &rsquo;tis so troublesome to send it among them, and
get their corrections, that I am weary as a dog.&nbsp; I dined
to-day with the printer, and was there all the afternoon; and it
plagues me, and there&rsquo;s an end, and what would you
have?&nbsp; Lady Dupplin, Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s daughter, <a
name="citation335c"></a><a href="#footnote335c"
class="citation">[335c]</a> is brought to bed of a son.&nbsp;
Lord Treasurer has had an ugly return of his gravel.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis good for us to live in gravel pits, <a
name="citation335d"></a><a href="#footnote335d"
class="citation">[335d]</a> but not for gravel pits to live in
us; a man in this case should leave no stone unturned.&nbsp; Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s sickness, the Queen&rsquo;s gout, the
forwarding the peace, occasion putting off the Parliament a
fortnight longer.&nbsp; My head has had no ill returns.&nbsp; I
had good walking to-day in the City, and take all opportunities
of it <a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>on
purpose for my health; but I can&rsquo;t walk in the Park,
because that is only for walking&rsquo;s sake, and loses time, so
I mix it with business.&nbsp; I wish MD walked half as much as
Presto.&nbsp; If I was with you, I&rsquo;d make you walk; I would
walk behind or before you, and you should have masks on, and be
tucked up like anything; and Stella is naturally a stout walker,
and carries herself firm; methinks I see her strut, and step
clever over a kennel; and Dingley would do well enough if her
petticoats were pinned up; but she is so embroiled, and so
fearful, and then Stella scolds, and Dingley stumbles, and is so
daggled. <a name="citation336a"></a><a href="#footnote336a"
class="citation">[336a]</a>&nbsp; Have you got the whalebone
petticoats among you yet?&nbsp; I hate them; a woman here may
hide a moderate gallant under them.&nbsp; Pshaw, what&rsquo;s all
this I&rsquo;m saying?&nbsp; Methinks I am talking to MD face to
face.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Did I tell you that old Frowde, <a
name="citation336b"></a><a href="#footnote336b"
class="citation">[336b]</a> the old fool, is selling his estate
at Pepperhara, and is skulking about the town nobody knows where?
and who do you think manages all this for him, but that rogue
Child, <a name="citation336c"></a><a href="#footnote336c"
class="citation">[336c]</a> the double squire of Farnham?&nbsp; I
have put Mrs. Masham, the Queen&rsquo;s favourite, upon buying
it, but that is yet a great secret; and I have employed Lady
Oglethorpe to inquire about it.&nbsp; I was with Lady Oglethorpe
to-day, who is come to town for a week or two, and to-morrow I
will see to hunt out the old fool: he is utterly ruined, and at
this present in some blind alley with some dirty wench.&nbsp; He
has two sons that must starve, and he never gives them a
farthing.&nbsp; If Mrs. Masham buys the land, I will desire her
to get the Queen to give some pension to the old fool, to keep
him from absolutely starving.&nbsp; What do you meddle with other
people&rsquo;s affairs for? says Stella.&nbsp; Oh, but Mr. <a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>Masham and
his wife are very urgent with me, since I first put them in the
head of it.&nbsp; I dined with Sir Matthew Dudley, who, I doubt,
will soon lose his employment.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I am going to hunt out old Frowde,
and to do some business in the City.&nbsp; I have not yet called
to Patrick to know whether it be fair.&mdash;It has been past
dropping these two days.&nbsp; Rainy weather hurts my pate and my
purse.&nbsp; He tells me &rsquo;tis very windy, and begins to
look dark; woe be to my shillings! an old saying and a true,</p>
<p class="poetry">Few fillings,<br />
Many shillings.</p>
<p>If the day be dark, my purse will be light.</p>
<p class="poetry">To my enemies be this curse,<br />
A dark day and a light purse.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll rise, and go to my fire, for Patrick tells
me I have a fire; yet it is not shaving-day, nor is the weather
cold; this is too extravagant.&nbsp; What is become of
Dilly?&nbsp; I suppose you have him with you.&nbsp; Stella is
just now showing a white leg, and putting it into the
slipper.&nbsp; Present my service to her, and tell her I am
engaged to the Dean, and desire she will come too: or, Dingley,
can&rsquo;t you write a note?&nbsp; This is Stella&rsquo;s
morning dialogue, no, morning speech I mean.&mdash;Morrow,
sirrahs, and let me rise as well as you; but I promise you Walls
can&rsquo;t dine with the Dean to-day, for she is to be at Mrs.
Proby&rsquo;s just after dinner, and to go with Gracy Spencer <a
name="citation337"></a><a href="#footnote337"
class="citation">[337]</a> to the shops to buy a yard of muslin,
and a silver lace for an under petticoat.&nbsp; Morrow again,
sirrahs.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I dined with Stratford in the
City, but could not finish my affairs with him; but now I am
resolved to buy five hundred pounds South Sea Stock, which will
cost me three hundred and eighty ready money; and I will make use
of the bill of a hundred pounds you sent me, and transfer Mrs.
Walls over to Hawkshaw; or if she dislikes it, I will borrow a
hundred pounds of the Secretary, and repay her.&nbsp; Three
shillings coach-hire to-day.&nbsp; I have spoken to
Frowde&rsquo;s <a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>brother to get me the lowest price of the estate, to
tell Mrs. Masham.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; I dined privately with a friend to-day in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Last Saturday night I came home, and the
drab had just washed my room, and my bed-chamber was all wet, and
I was forced to go to bed in my own defence, and no fire: I was
sick on Sunday, and now have got a swingeing cold.&nbsp; I
scolded like a dog at Patrick, although he was out with me: I
detest washing of rooms; can&rsquo;t they wash them in a morning,
and make a fire, and leave open the windows?&nbsp; I slept not a
wink last night for hawking <a name="citation338a"></a><a
href="#footnote338a" class="citation">[338a]</a> and spitting:
and now everybody has colds.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a clutter:
I&rsquo;ll go to bed and sleep if I can.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; Lady Mountjoy sent to me two days ago, so I dined
with her to-day, and in the evening went to see Lord
Treasurer.&nbsp; I found Patrick had been just there with a how
d&rsquo;ye, <a name="citation338b"></a><a href="#footnote338b"
class="citation">[338b]</a> and my lord had returned answer that
he desired to see me.&nbsp; Mrs. Masham was with him when I came,
and they are never disturbed: &rsquo;tis well she is not very
handsome; they sit alone together settling the nation.&nbsp; I
sat with Lady Oxford, and stopped Mrs. Masham as she came out,
and told her what progress I had made, etc., and then went to
Lord Treasurer: he is very well, only uneasy at rising or
sitting, with some rheumatic pain in his thigh, and a foot
weak.&nbsp; He showed me a small paper, sent by an unknown hand
to one Mr. Cook, who sent it to my lord: it was written in plain
large letters thus</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Though G&mdash;d&rsquo;s knife did not
succeed,<br />
A F&mdash;n&rsquo;s yet may do the deed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a little below: &ldquo;<i>Burn this</i>, <i>you
dog</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; My lord has <a name="page339"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 339</span>frequently such letters as these:
once he showed me one, which was a vision describing a certain
man, his dress, his sword, and his countenance, who was to murder
my lord.&nbsp; And he told me he saw a fellow in the chapel at
Windsor with a dress very like it.&nbsp; They often send him
letters signed, &ldquo;Your humble servant, The Devil,&rdquo; and
such stuff.&nbsp; I sat with him till after ten, and have
business to do.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; The Secretary came yesterday to town from Hampton
Court, so I went to him early this morning; but he went back last
night again: and coming home to-night I found a letter from him
to tell me that he was just come from Hampton Court, and just
returning, and will not be here till Saturday night.&nbsp; A pox
take him! he stops all my business.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll beg leave to
come back when I have got over this, and hope to see MD in
Ireland soon after Christmas.&mdash;I&rsquo;m weary of Courts,
and want my journeys to Laracor; they did me more good than all
the Ministries these twenty years.&nbsp; I dined to-day in the
City, but did no business as I designed.&nbsp; Lady Mountjoy
tells me that Dilly is got to Ireland, and that the Archbishop of
Dublin was the cause of his returning so soon.&nbsp; The
Parliament was prorogued two days ago for a fortnight, which,
with the Queen&rsquo;s absence, makes the town very dull and
empty.&nbsp; They tell me the Duke of Ormond brings all the world
away with him from Ireland.&nbsp; London has nothing so bad in it
in winter as your knots of Irish folks; but I go to no
coffee-house, and so I seldom see them.&nbsp; This letter shall
go on Saturday; and then I am even with the world again.&nbsp; I
have lent money, and cannot get it, and am forced to borrow for
myself.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; My man made a blunder this morning, and let up a
visitor, when I had ordered to see nobody; so I was forced to
hurry a hang-dog instrument of mine into my bed-chamber, and keep
him cooling his heels there above an hour.&mdash;I am going on
fairly in the common forms of a great cold; I believe it will
last me about ten days in all.&mdash;I should have told you, that
in those two verses sent to Lord Treasurer, G&mdash;d stands for
Guiscard; that is easy; but we differed <a
name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>about
F&mdash;n; I thought it was for Frenchman, because he hates them,
and they him: and so it would be, That although Guiscard&rsquo;s
knife missed its design, the knife of a Frenchman might yet do
it.&nbsp; My lord thinks it stands for Felton, the name of him
that stabbed the first Duke of Buckingham. Sir Andrew Fountaine
and I dined with the Vans to-day, and my cold made me loiter all
the evening.&nbsp; Stay, young women, don&rsquo;t you begin to
owe me a letter? just a month to-day since I had your N.
22.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stay a week longer, and then, I&rsquo;ll
expect like agog; till then you may play at ombre, and so forth,
as you please.&nbsp; The Whigs are still crying down our peace,
but we will have it, I hope, in spite of them: the Emperor comes
now with his two eggs a penny, and promises wonders to continue
the war; but it is too late; only I hope the fear of it will
serve to spur on the French to be easy and sincere:&nbsp; Night,
sirrahs; I&rsquo;ll go early to bed.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; This goes to-night; I will put it
myself in the post-office.&nbsp; I had just now a long letter
from the Archbishop of Dublin, giving me an account of the ending
your session, how it ended in a storm; which storm, by the time
it arrives here, will be only half nature.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
help it, I won&rsquo;t hide.&nbsp; I often advised the
dissolution of that Parliament, although I did not think the
scoundrels had so much courage; but they have it only in the
wrong, like a bully that will fight for a whore, and run away in
an army.&nbsp; I believe, by several things the Archbishop says,
he is not very well either with the Government or
clergy.&mdash;See how luckily my paper ends with a
fortnight.&mdash;God Almighty bless and preserve dearest little
MD.&mdash;I suppose your Lord Lieutenant is now setting out for
England.&nbsp; I wonder the Bishop of Clogher does not write to
me, or let me know of his statues, and how he likes them: I will
write to him again, as soon as I have leisure.&nbsp; Farewell,
dearest MD, and love Presto, who loves MD infinitely above all
earthly things, and who will.&mdash;My service to Mrs. Stoyte and
Catherine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sitting in my bed, but will rise to
seal this.&nbsp; Morrow, dear rogues: Farewell again, dearest MD,
etc.</p>

341</span>LETTER XXXV.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Nov.</i> 17, 1711.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">put</span> my last this evening in the
post-office.&nbsp; I dined with Dr. Cockburn.&nbsp; This being
Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s birthday, we have the D&mdash; and all to
do among us.&nbsp; I just heard of the stir as my letter was
sealed this morning, and was so cross I would not open it to tell
you.&nbsp; I have been visiting Lady Oglethorpe <a
name="citation341a"></a><a href="#footnote341a"
class="citation">[341a]</a> and Lady Worsley; <a
name="citation341b"></a><a href="#footnote341b"
class="citation">[341b]</a> the latter is lately come to town for
the winter, and with child, and what care you?&nbsp; This is
Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s birthday, usually kept in this town by
apprentices, etc.; but the Whigs designed a mighty procession by
midnight, and had laid out a thousand pounds to dress up the
Pope, Devil, cardinals, Sacheverell, etc., and carry them with
torches about, and burn them.&nbsp; They did it by
contribution.&nbsp; Garth gave five guineas; Dr. Garth I mean, if
ever you heard of him.&nbsp; But they were seized last night, by
order from the Secretary: you will have an account of it, for
they bawl it about the streets already. <a
name="citation341c"></a><a href="#footnote341c"
class="citation">[341c]</a>&nbsp; They had some very foolish and
mischievous designs; and it was thought they would have put the
rabble upon assaulting my Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s house and the
Secretary&rsquo;s, and other violences.&nbsp; The militia was
raised to prevent it, and now, I suppose, all will be
quiet.&nbsp; The figures are now at the Secretary&rsquo;s office
at Whitehall.&nbsp; I design to see them if I can.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; I was this morning with Mr. Secretary, who just came
from Hampton Court.&nbsp; He was telling me more particulars
about this business of burning the Pope.&nbsp; It cost a great
deal of money, and had it gone on, would have cost three times as
much; but the town is full of it, and half a dozen <a
name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>Grub Street
papers already.&nbsp; The Secretary and I dined at Brigadier
Britton&rsquo;s, but I left them at six, upon an appointment with
some sober company of men and ladies, to drink punch at Sir
Andrew Fountaine&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We were not very merry; and I
don&rsquo;t love rack punch, I love it better with brandy; are
you of my opinion?&nbsp; Why then, twelvepenny weather; sirrahs,
why don&rsquo;t you play at shuttlecock?&nbsp; I have thought of
it a hundred times; faith, Presto will come over after Christmas,
and will play with Stella before the cold weather is gone.&nbsp;
Do you read the <i>Spectators</i>?&nbsp; I never do; they never
come in my way; I go to no coffee-houses.&nbsp; They say
abundance of them are very pretty; they are going to be printed
in small volumes; I&rsquo;ll bring them over with me.&nbsp; I
shall be out of my hurry in a week, and if Leigh be not gone
over, I will send you by him what I am now finishing.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know where Leigh is; I have not seen him this good
while, though he promised to call: I shall send to him.&nbsp; The
Queen comes to town on Thursday for good and all.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; I was this morning at Lord Dartmouth&rsquo;s office,
and sent out for him from the Committee of Council, about some
business.&nbsp; I was asking him more concerning this bustle
about the figures in wax-work of the Pope, and Devil, etc.&nbsp;
He was not at leisure, or he would have seen them.&nbsp; I hear
the owners are so impudent, that they design to replevin them by
law.&nbsp; I am assured that the figure of the Devil is made as
like Lord Treasurer as they could.&nbsp; Why, I dined with a
friend in St. James&rsquo;s Street.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer, I am
told, was abroad to-day; I will know to-morrow how he does after
it.&nbsp; The Duke of Marlborough is come, and was yesterday at
Hampton Court with the Queen; no, it was t&rsquo;other day; no,
it was yesterday; for to-day I remember Mr. Secretary was going
to see him, when I was there, not at the Duke of
Marlborough&rsquo;s, but at the Secretary&rsquo;s; the Duke is
not so fond of me.&nbsp; What care I?&nbsp; I won seven shillings
to-night at picquet: I play twice a year or so.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; I have been so teased with Whiggish discourse by <a
name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>Mrs. Barton
and Lady Betty Germaine, never saw the like.&nbsp; They turn all
this affair of the Pope-burning into ridicule; and, indeed, they
have made too great a clutter about it, if they had no real
reason to apprehend some tumults.&nbsp; I dined with Lady
Betty.&nbsp; I hear Prior&rsquo;s commission is passed to be
Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary for the peace; my
Lord Privy Seal, who you know is Bishop of Bristol, is the other;
and Lord Strafford, already Ambassador at The Hague, the third: I
am forced to tell you, ignorant sluts, who is who.&nbsp; I was
punning scurvily with Sir Andrew Fountaine and Lord Pembroke this
evening: do you ever pun now?&nbsp; Sometimes with the Dean, or
Tom Leigh. <a name="citation343a"></a><a href="#footnote343a"
class="citation">[343a]</a>&nbsp; Prior puns very well.&nbsp;
Odso, I must go see His Excellency, &rsquo;tis a noble
advancement: but they could do no less, after sending him to
France.&nbsp; Lord Strafford is as proud as Hell, and how he will
bear one of Prior&rsquo;s mean birth on an equal character with
him, I know not.&nbsp; And so I go to my business, and bid you
good-night.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; I was this morning busy with my printer: I gave him
the fifth sheet, <a name="citation343b"></a><a
href="#footnote343b" class="citation">[343b]</a> and then I went
and dined with him in the City, to correct something, and alter,
etc., and I walked home in the dusk, and the rain overtook me:
and I found a letter here from Mr. Lewis; well, and so I opened
it; and he says the peace is past danger, etc.&nbsp; Well, and so
there was another letter enclosed in his: well, and so I looked
on the outside of this t&rsquo;other letter.&nbsp; Well, and so
who do you think this t&rsquo;other letter was from?&nbsp; Well,
and so I&rsquo;ll tell you; it was from little MD, N. 23, 23, 23,
23.&nbsp; I tell you it is no more, I have told you so before:
but I just looked again to satisfy you.&nbsp; Hie, Stella, you
write like an emperor, a great deal together; a very good hand,
and but four false spellings in all.&nbsp; Shall I send them to
you?&nbsp; I am glad you did not take my correction ill.&nbsp;
Well, but I won&rsquo;t answer your letter now, sirrah
saucyboxes, no, no; not yet; just a <a name="page344"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 344</span>month and three days from the last,
which is just five weeks: you see it comes just when I begin to
grumble.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Tooke has just brought me
Dingley&rsquo;s money.&nbsp; I will give you a note for it at the
end of this letter.&nbsp; There was half a crown for entering the
letter of attorney; but I swore to stop that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
spend your money bravely here.&nbsp; Morrow, dear
sirrahs.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Sir Thomas
Hanmer; his wife, the Duchess of Grafton, <a
name="citation344a"></a><a href="#footnote344a"
class="citation">[344a]</a> dined with us: she wears a great high
head-dress, such as was in fashion fifteen years ago, and looks
like a mad woman in it; yet she has great remains of
beauty.&nbsp; I was this evening to see Lord Harley, and thought
to have sat with Lord Treasurer, but he was taken up with the
Dutch Envoy and such folks; and I would not stay.&nbsp; One
particular in life here, different from what I have in Dublin,
is, that whenever I come home I expect to find some letter for
me, and seldom miss; and never any worth a farthing, but often to
vex me.&nbsp; The Queen does not come to town till
Saturday.&nbsp; Prior is not yet declared; but these Ministers
being at Hampton Court, I know nothing; and if I write news from
common hands, it is always lies.&nbsp; You will think it
affectation; but nothing has vexed me more for some months past,
than people I never saw pretending to be acquainted with me, and
yet speak ill of me too; at least some of them.&nbsp; An old
crooked Scotch countess, whom I never heard of in my life, told
the Duchess of Hamilton <a name="citation344b"></a><a
href="#footnote344b" class="citation">[344b]</a> t&rsquo;other
day that I often visited her.&nbsp; People of worth never do
that; so that a man only gets the scandal of having scurvy
acquaintance.&nbsp; Three ladies were railing against me some
time ago, and said they were very well acquainted with me; two of
which I had never heard of, and the third I had only seen twice
where I happened to visit.&nbsp; A man who has once seen me in a
coffee-house will ask me how I do, when he sees me talking at <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>Court with
a Minister of State; who is sure to ask me how I came acquainted
with that scoundrel.&nbsp; But come, sirrahs, this is all stuff
to you, so I&rsquo;ll say no more on this side the paper, but
turn over.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; My printer invited Mr. Lewis and me to dine at a
tavern to-day, which I have not done five times since I came to
England; I never will call it Britain, pray don&rsquo;t call it
Britain.&nbsp; My week is not out, and one side of this paper is
out, and I have a letter to answer of MD&rsquo;s into the
bargain: must I write on the third side? faith, that will give
you an ill habit.&nbsp; I saw Leigh last night: he gives a
terrible account of Sterne; he reckons he is seduced by some
wench; he is over head and ears in debt, and has pawned several
things.&nbsp; Leigh says he goes on Monday next for Ireland, but
believes Sterne will not go with him; Sterne has kept him these
three months.&nbsp; Leigh has got the apron and things, and
promises to call for the box at Chester; but I despair of
it.&nbsp; Good-night, sirrahs; I have been late abroad.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; I have finished my pamphlet <a
name="citation345a"></a><a href="#footnote345a"
class="citation">[345a]</a> to-day, which has cost me so much
time and trouble: it will be published in three or four days,
when the Parliament begins sitting.&nbsp; I suppose the Queen is
come to town, but know nothing, having been in the City finishing
and correcting with the printer.&nbsp; When I came home, I found
letters on my table as usual, and one from your mother, to tell
me that you desire your writings and a picture should be sent to
me, to be sent over to you.&nbsp; I have just answered her
letter, and promised to take care of them if they be sent to
me.&nbsp; She is at Farnham: it is too late to send them by
Leigh; besides, I will wait your orders, Madam Stella.&nbsp; I am
going to finish a letter to Lord Treasurer about reforming our
language; <a name="citation345b"></a><a href="#footnote345b"
class="citation">[345b]</a> but first I must put an end to a
ballad; and go you to your cards, sirrahs, this is card
season.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; I was early with the Secretary to-day, but he was
gone to his devotions, and to receive the sacrament: several
rakes did the same; it was not for piety, but employments;
according <a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>to Act of Parliament.&nbsp; I dined with Lady Mary
Dudley; <a name="citation346a"></a><a href="#footnote346a"
class="citation">[346a]</a> and passed my time since insipidly,
only I was at Court at noon, and saw fifty acquaintance I had not
met this long time: that is the advantage of a Court, and I fancy
I am better known than any man that goes there.&nbsp; Sir John
Walter&rsquo;s <a name="citation346b"></a><a href="#footnote346b"
class="citation">[346b]</a> quarrel with me has entertained the
town ever since; and yet we never had a word, only he railed at
me behind my back.&nbsp; The Parliament is again to be prorogued
for eight or nine days, for the Whigs are too strong in the House
of Lords: other reasons are pretended, but that is the
truth.&nbsp; The prorogation is not yet known, but will be
to-morrow.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; Mr. Lewis and I dined with a friend of his, and
unexpectedly there dined with us an Irish knight, one Sir John
St. Leger, <a name="citation346c"></a><a href="#footnote346c"
class="citation">[346c]</a> who follows the law here, but at a
great distance: he was so pert, I was forced to take him down
more than once.&nbsp; I saw to-day the Pope, and Devil, and the
other figures of cardinals, etc., fifteen in all, which have made
such a noise.&nbsp; I have put an under-strapper upon writing a
twopenny pamphlet <a name="citation346d"></a><a
href="#footnote346d" class="citation">[346d]</a> to give an
account of the whole design.&nbsp; My large pamphlet <a
name="citation346e"></a><a href="#footnote346e"
class="citation">[346e]</a> will be published to-morrow; copies
are sent to the great men this night.&nbsp; Domville <a
name="citation346f"></a><a href="#footnote346f"
class="citation">[346f]</a> is come home from his travels; I am
vexed at it: I have not seen him yet; I design to present him to
all the great men.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; Domville came to me this morning, and we dined at
Pontack&rsquo;s, and were all day together, till six this
evening: he is perfectly as fine a gentleman as I know; he set me
down at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s, with whom I stayed about an hour,
till Monsieur Buys, the Dutch Envoy, came to him about
business.&nbsp; My Lord Treasurer is pretty well, but stiff in
the <a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>hips
with the remains of the rheumatism.&nbsp; I am to bring Domville
to my Lord Harley in a day or two.&nbsp; It was the dirtiest
rainy day that ever I saw.&nbsp; The pamphlet is published; Lord
Treasurer had it by him on the table, and was asking me about the
mottoes in the title-page; he gave me one of them himself. <a
name="citation347a"></a><a href="#footnote347a"
class="citation">[347a]</a>&nbsp; I must send you the pamphlet,
if I can.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; Mrs. Van sent to me to dine with her to-day, because
some ladies of my acquaintance were to be there; and there I
dined.&nbsp; I was this morning to return Domville his visit, and
went to visit Mrs. Masham, who was not within.&nbsp; I am turned
out of my lodging by my landlady: it seems her husband and her
son are coming home; but I have taken another lodging hard by, in
Leicester Fields.&nbsp; I presented Mr. Domville to Mr. Lewis and
Mr. Prior this morning.&nbsp; Prior and I are called the two
Sosias, <a name="citation347b"></a><a href="#footnote347b"
class="citation">[347b]</a> in a Whig newspaper.&nbsp; Sosias,
can you read it?&nbsp; The pamphlet begins to make a noise: I was
asked by several whether I had seen it, and they advised me to
read it, for it was something very extraordinary.&nbsp; I shall
be suspected; and it will have several paltry answers.&nbsp; It
must take its fate, as Savage <a name="citation347c"></a><a
href="#footnote347c" class="citation">[347c]</a> said of his
sermon that he preached at Farnham on Sir William Temple&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; Domville saw Savage in Italy, and says he is a
coxcomb, and half mad: he goes in red, and with yellow
waistcoats, and was at ceremony kneeling to the Pope on a Palm
Sunday, which is much more than kissing his toe; and I believe it
will ruin him here when &rsquo;tis told.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll answer
your letter in my new lodgings: I have hardly room; I must borrow
from the other side.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; New lodgings.&nbsp; My printer came this morning to
tell me he must immediately print a second edition, <a
name="citation347d"></a><a href="#footnote347d"
class="citation">[347d]</a> and Lord Treasurer made one or two
small additions: they must work day and night to have it out on
Saturday; they sold a <a name="page348"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 348</span>thousand in two days.&nbsp; Our
Society met to-day; nine of us were present: we dined at our
brother Bathurst&rsquo;s. <a name="citation348a"></a><a
href="#footnote348a" class="citation">[348a]</a>&nbsp; We made
several regulations, and have chosen three new members, Lord
Orrery, <a name="citation348b"></a><a href="#footnote348b"
class="citation">[348b]</a> Jack Hill, who is Mrs. Masham&rsquo;s
brother, he that lately miscarried in the expedition to Quebec,
and one Colonel Disney. <a name="citation348c"></a><a
href="#footnote348c" class="citation">[348c]</a>&mdash;We have
taken a room in a house near St. James&rsquo;s to meet in.&nbsp;
I left them early about correcting the pamphlet, etc., and am now
got home, etc.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; This morning I carried Domville to see my Lord
Harley, and I did some business with Lord Treasurer, and have
been all this afternoon with the printer, adding something to the
second edition.&nbsp; I dined with the printer: the pamphlet
makes a world of noise, and will do a great deal of good; it
tells abundance of most important facts which were not at all
known.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll answer your letter to-morrow morning; or
suppose I answer it just now, though it is pretty late.&nbsp;
Come then.&mdash;You say you are busy with Parliaments, etc.;
that&rsquo;s more than ever I will be when I come back; but you
will have none these two years.&nbsp; Lord Santry, etc., yes, I
have had enough on&rsquo;t. <a name="citation348d"></a><a
href="#footnote348d" class="citation">[348d]</a>&nbsp; I am glad
Dilly is mended; does not he thank me for showing him the Court
and the great people&rsquo;s faces?&nbsp; He had his glass out at
the Queen and the rest.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis right what Dilly says: I
depend upon nothing from my friends, but to go back as I
came.&nbsp; Never fear Laracor, &rsquo;twill mend with a peace,
or surely they&rsquo;ll give me the Dublin parish.&nbsp; Stella
is in the right: the Bishop of Ossory <a
name="citation348e"></a><a href="#footnote348e"
class="citation">[348e]</a> is the silliest, best-natured wretch
breathing, of as little consequence as an egg-shell.&nbsp; Well,
the spelling I have mentioned before; only the next time say
<i>at least</i>, and not <a name="page349"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 349</span><i>at lest</i>.&nbsp; Pox on your
Newbury! <a name="citation349a"></a><a href="#footnote349a"
class="citation">[349a]</a> what can I do for him?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll give his case (I am glad it is not a woman&rsquo;s) to
what members I know; that&rsquo;s all I can do.&nbsp; Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s lameness goes off daily.&nbsp; Pray God
preserve poor good Mrs. Stoyte; she would be a great loss to us
all: pray give her my service, and tell her she has my heartiest
prayers.&nbsp; I pity poor Mrs. Manley; but I think the child is
happy to die, considering how little provision it would have
had.&mdash;Poh, every pamphlet abuses me, and for things that I
never writ.&nbsp; Joe <a name="citation349b"></a><a
href="#footnote349b" class="citation">[349b]</a> should have
written me thanks for his two hundred pounds: I reckon he got it
by my means; and I must thank the Duke of Ormond, who I dare
swear will say he did it on my account.&nbsp; Are they golden
pippins, those seven apples?&nbsp; We have had much rain every
day as well as you.&nbsp; &pound;7, 17s., 8d., old blunderer, not
18s.: I have reckoned it eighteen times.&nbsp; Hawkshaw&rsquo;s
eight pounds is not reckoned and if it be secure, it may lie
where it is, unless they desire to pay it: so Parvisol may let it
drop till further orders; for I have put Mrs. Wesley&rsquo;s
money into the Bank, and will pay her with
Hawkshaw&rsquo;s.&mdash;I mean that Hawkshaw&rsquo;s money goes
for an addition to MD, you know; but be good housewives.&nbsp;
Bernage never comes now to see me; he has no more to ask; but I
hear he has been ill.&mdash;A pox on Mrs. South&rsquo;s <a
name="citation349c"></a><a href="#footnote349c"
class="citation">[349c]</a> affair; I can do nothing in it, but
by way of assisting anybody else that solicits it, by dropping a
favourable word, if it comes in my way.&nbsp; Tell Walls I do no
more for anybody with my Lord Treasurer, especially a thing of
this kind.&nbsp; Tell him I have spent all my discretion, and
have no more to use.&mdash;And so I have answered your letter
fully and plainly.&mdash;And so I have got to the third side of
my paper, which is more than belongs to you, young women.</p>
<p class="poetry">It goes to-morrow,<br />
To nobody&rsquo;s sorrow.</p>
<p>You are silly, not I; I&rsquo;m a poet, if I had but,
etc.&mdash;Who&rsquo;s silly now? rogues and lasses, tinderboxes
and buzzards.&nbsp; O <a name="page350"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 350</span>Lord, I am in a high vein of
silliness; methought I was speaking to dearest little MD face to
face.&nbsp; There; so, lads, enough for to-night; to cards with
the blackguards.&nbsp; Good-night, my delight, etc.</p>
<p>Dec. 1.&nbsp; Pish, sirrahs, put a date always at the bottom
of your letter, as well as the top, that I may know when you send
it; your last is of November 3, yet I had others at the same
time, written a fortnight after.&nbsp; Whenever you would have
any money, send me word three weeks before, and in that time you
will certainly have an answer, with a bill on Parvisol: pray do
this; for my head is full, and it will ease my memory.&nbsp; Why,
I think I quoted to you some of &mdash;&rsquo;s letter, so you
may imagine how witty the rest was; for it was all of a bunch, as
Goodman Peesley <a name="citation350"></a><a href="#footnote350"
class="citation">[350]</a> says.&nbsp; Pray let us have no more
<i>bussiness</i>, but <i>busyness</i>: the deuce take me if I
know how to spell it; your wrong spelling, Madam Stella, has put
me out: it does not look right; let me see, <i>bussiness</i>,
<i>busyness</i>, <i>business</i>, <i>bisyness</i>,
<i>bisness</i>, <i>bysness</i>; faith, I know not which is right,
I think the second; I believe I never writ the word in my life
before; yes, sure I must, though; <i>business</i>,
<i>busyness</i>, <i>bisyness</i>.&mdash;I have perplexed myself,
and can&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; Prithee ask Walls.&nbsp;
<i>Business</i>, I fancy that&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; Yes it is; I
looked in my own pamphlet, and found it twice in ten lines, to
convince you that I never writ it before.&nbsp; Oh, now I see it
as plain as can be; so yours is only an <i>s</i> too much.&nbsp;
The Parliament will certainly meet on Friday next: the Whigs will
have a great majority in the House of Lords, no care is taken to
prevent it; there is too much neglect; they are warned of it, and
that signifies nothing: it was feared there would be some peevish
address from the Lords against a peace.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis said
about the town that several of the Allies begin now to be content
that a peace should be treated.&nbsp; This is all the news I
have.&nbsp; The Queen is pretty well: and so now I bid poor
dearest MD farewell till to-night; then I will talk with them
again.</p>
<p>The fifteen images that I saw were not worth forty <a

<h3>LETTER XXXVI.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Dec.</i> 1, 1711.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> last was put in this
evening.&nbsp; I intended to dine with Mr. Masham to-day, and
called at White&rsquo;s chocolate house to see if he was
there.&nbsp; Lord Wharton saw me at the door, and I saw him, but
took no notice, and was going away, but he came through the
crowd, called after me, and asked me how I did, etc.&nbsp; This
was pretty; and I believe he wished every word he spoke was a
halter to hang me.&nbsp; Masham did not dine at home, so I ate
with a friend in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The printer has not
sent me the second edition; I know not the reason, for it
certainly came out to-day; perhaps they are glutted with it
already.&nbsp; I found a letter from Lord Harley on my table, to
tell me that his father desires I would make two small
alterations.&nbsp; I am going to be busy, etc.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; See the blunder; I was making it the
37th day of the month, from the number above.&nbsp; Well, but I
am staying here for old Frowde, who appointed to call this
morning: I am ready dressed to go to church: I suppose he dare
not stir out but on Sundays. <a name="citation351b"></a><a
href="#footnote351b" class="citation">[351b]</a>&nbsp; The
printer called early this morning, told me the second edition
went off yesterday in five hours, and he must have a third ready
to-morrow, for they might have sold half another: his men are all
at work with it, though it be Sunday.&nbsp; This <a
name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>old fool
will not come, and I shall miss church.&nbsp; Morrow,
sirrahs.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I was at Court to-day: the Queen
is well, and walked through part of the rooms.&nbsp; I dined with
the Secretary, and despatched some business.&nbsp; He tells me
the Dutch Envoy designs to complain of that pamphlet.&nbsp; The
noise it makes is extraordinary.&nbsp; It is fit it should answer
the pains I have been at about it.&nbsp; I suppose it will be
printed in Ireland.&nbsp; Some lay it to Prior, others to Mr.
Secretary St. John, but I am always the first they lay everything
to.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go sleep, etc.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I have ordered Patrick not to let any odd fellow come
up to me; and a fellow would needs speak with me from Sir George
Pretyman. <a name="citation352a"></a><a href="#footnote352a"
class="citation">[352a]</a>&nbsp; I had never heard of him, and
would not see the messenger: but at last it proved that this Sir
George has sold his estate, and is a beggar.&nbsp; Smithers, the
Farnham carrier, brought me this morning a letter from your
mother, with three papers enclosed of Lady Giffard&rsquo;s
writing; one owning some exchequer business of &pound;100 to be
Stella&rsquo;s; <a name="citation352b"></a><a
href="#footnote352b" class="citation">[352b]</a> another for
&pound;100 that she has of yours, which I made over to you for
Mariston; and a third for &pound;300; the last is on stamped
paper.&nbsp; I think they had better lie in England in some good
hand till Lady Giffard dies; and I will think of some such hand
before I come over.&nbsp; I was asking Smithers about all the
people of Farnham.&nbsp; Mrs. White <a name="citation352c"></a><a
href="#footnote352c" class="citation">[352c]</a> has left off
dressing, is troubled with lameness and swelled legs, and seldom
stirs out; but her old hang-dog husband as hearty as ever.&nbsp;
I was this morning with Lord Treasurer, about something he would
have altered in the pamphlet; <a name="citation352d"></a><a
href="#footnote352d" class="citation">[352d]</a> but it
can&rsquo;t be till the fourth edition, which I believe will be
soon; for I dined with the printer, and he tells me they have
sold off half the third.&nbsp; Mrs. Perceval <a
name="citation352e"></a><a href="#footnote352e"
class="citation">[352e]</a> and her daughter have been in town <a
name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 353</span>these three
weeks, which I never heard till to-day; and Mrs. Wesley <a
name="citation353a"></a><a href="#footnote353a"
class="citation">[353a]</a> is come to town too, to consult Dr.
Radcliffe.&nbsp; The Whigs are resolved to bring that pamphlet
into the House of Lords to have it condemned, so I hear.&nbsp;
But the printer will stand to it, and not own the author; he must
say he had it from the penny-post.&nbsp; Some people talk as if
the House of Lords would do some peevish thing, for the Whigs are
now a great majority in it; our Ministers are too negligent of
such things: I have never slipped giving them warning; some of
them are sensible of it; but Lord Treasurer stands too much upon
his own legs.&nbsp; I fancy his good fortune will bear him out in
everything; but in reason I should think this Ministry to stand
very unsteady; if they can carry a peace, they may hold; I
believe not else.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary sent to me to-day to dine with him
alone; but we had two more with us, which hindered me doing some
business.&nbsp; I was this morning with young Harcourt, secretary
to our Society, to take a room for our weekly meetings; and the
fellow asked us five guineas a week only to have leave to dine
once a week; was not that pretty? so we broke off with him, and
are to dine next Thursday at Harcourt&rsquo;s (he is Lord
Keeper&rsquo;s son).&nbsp; They have sold off above half the
third edition, and answers are coming out: the Dutch Envoy
refused dining with Dr. Davenant, <a name="citation353b"></a><a
href="#footnote353b" class="citation">[353b]</a> because he was
suspected to write it: I have made some alterations in every
edition, and it has cost me more trouble, for the time, since the
printing, than before.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis sent over to Ireland, and
I suppose you will have it reprinted.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; They are now printing the fourth edition, which is
reckoned very extraordinary, considering &rsquo;tis a dear
twelvepenny book, and not bought up in numbers by the party to
give away, as the Whigs do, but purely upon its own
strength.&nbsp; <a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
354</span>I have got an under spur-leather to write an
<i>Examiner</i> again, <a name="citation354a"></a><a
href="#footnote354a" class="citation">[354a]</a> and the
Secretary and I will now and then send hints; but we would have
it a little upon the Grub Street, to be a match for their
writers.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Treasurer to-day at five: he
dined by himself after his family, and drinks no claret yet, for
fear of his rheumatism, of which he is almost well.&nbsp; He was
very pleasant, as he is always: yet I fancied he was a little
touched with the present posture of affairs.&nbsp; The Elector of
Hanover&rsquo;s Minister here has given in a violent memorial
against the peace, and caused it to be printed.&nbsp; The Whig
lords are doing their utmost for a majority against Friday, and
design, if they can, to address the Queen against the
peace.&nbsp; Lord Nottingham, <a name="citation354b"></a><a
href="#footnote354b" class="citation">[354b]</a> a famous Tory
and speech-maker, is gone over to the Whig side: they toast him
daily, and Lord Wharton says, It is Dismal (so they call him from
his looks) will save England at last.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer was
hinting as if he wished a ballad was made on him, and I will get
up one against to-morrow. <a name="citation354c"></a><a
href="#footnote354c" class="citation">[354c]</a>&nbsp; He gave me
a scurrilous printed paper of bad verses on himself, under the
name of the English Catiline, and made me read them to the
company.&nbsp; It was his birthday, which he would not tell us,
but Lord Harley whispered it to me.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I was this morning making the ballad, two degrees
above Grub Street: at noon I paid a visit to Mrs. Masham, and
then went to dine with our Society.&nbsp; Poor Lord Keeper dined
below stairs, I suppose, on a bit of mutton.&nbsp; We chose two
members: we were eleven met, the greatest meeting we ever had: I
am next week to introduce Lord Orrery.&nbsp; The printer came
before we parted, and brought the ballad, <a
name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 355</span>which made
them laugh very heartily a dozen times.&nbsp; He is going to
print the pamphlet <a name="citation355"></a><a
href="#footnote355" class="citation">[355]</a> in small, a fifth
edition, to be taken off by friends, and sent into the
country.&nbsp; A sixpenny answer is come out, good for nothing,
but guessing me, among others, for the author.&nbsp; To-morrow is
the fatal day for the Parliament meeting, and we are full of
hopes and fears.&nbsp; We reckon we have a majority of ten on our
side in the House of Lords; yet I observed Mrs. Masham a little
uneasy: she assures me the Queen is stout.&nbsp; The Duke of
Marlborough has not seen the Queen for some days past; Mrs.
Masham is glad of it, because she says he tells a hundred lies to
his friends of what she says to him: he is one day humble, and
the next day on the high ropes.&nbsp; The Duke of Ormond, they
say, will be in town to-night by twelve.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; This being the day the Parliament was to meet, and
the great question to be determined, I went with Dr. Freind to
dine in the City, on purpose to be out of the way, and we sent
our printer to see what was our fate; but he gave us a most
melancholy account of things.&nbsp; The Earl of Nottingham began,
and spoke against a peace, and desired that in their address they
might put in a clause to advise the Queen not to make a peace
without Spain; which was debated, and carried by the Whigs by
about six voices: and this has happened entirely by my Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s neglect, who did not take timely care to make
up all his strength, although every one of us gave him caution
enough.&nbsp; Nottingham has certainly been bribed.&nbsp; The
question is yet only carried in the Committee of the whole House,
and we hope when it is reported to the House to-morrow, we shall
have a majority, by some Scotch lords coming to town.&nbsp;
However, it is a mighty blow and loss of reputation to Lord
Treasurer, and may end in his ruin.&nbsp; I hear the thing only
as the printer brought it, who was at the debate; but how the
Ministry take it, or what their hopes and fears are, I cannot
tell until I see them.&nbsp; I shall be early with the Secretary
to-morrow, and then I will tell you more, and shall write a full
account to the Bishop <a name="page356"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 356</span>of Clogher to-morrow, and to the
Archbishop of Dublin, if I have time.&nbsp; I am horribly down at
present.&nbsp; I long to know how Lord Treasurer bears this, and
what remedy he has.&nbsp; The Duke of Ormond came this day to
town, and was there.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; I was early this morning with the Secretary, and
talked over this matter.&nbsp; He hoped that when it was reported
this day in the House of Lords, they would disagree with their
Committee, and so the matter would go off, only with a little
loss of reputation to the Lord Treasurer.&nbsp; I dined with Mr.
Cockburn, and after, a Scotch member came in, and told us that
the clause was carried against the Court in the House of Lords
almost two to one.&nbsp; I went immediately to Mrs. Masham, and
meeting Dr. Arbuthnot (the Queen&rsquo;s favourite physician), we
went together.&nbsp; She was just come from waiting at the
Queen&rsquo;s dinner, and going to her own.&nbsp; She had heard
nothing of the thing being gone against us.&nbsp; It seems Lord
Treasurer had been so negligent that he was with the Queen while
the question was put in the House: I immediately told Mrs. Masham
that either she and Lord Treasurer had joined with the Queen to
betray us, or that they two were betrayed by the Queen: she
protested solemnly it was not the former, and I believed her; but
she gave me some lights to suspect the Queen is changed.&nbsp;
For yesterday, when the Queen was going from the House, where she
sat to hear the debate, the Duke of Shrewsbury, Lord Chamberlain,
asked her whether he or the Great Chamberlain Lindsey <a
name="citation356"></a><a href="#footnote356"
class="citation">[356]</a> ought to lead her out; she answered
short, &ldquo;Neither of you,&rdquo; and gave her hand to the
Duke of Somerset, who was louder than any in the House for the
clause against peace.&nbsp; She gave me one or two more instances
of this sort, which convince me that the Queen is false, or at
least very much wavering.&nbsp; Mr. Masham begged us to stay,
because Lord Treasurer would call, and we were resolved to fall
on him about his negligence in securing a <a
name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span>majority.&nbsp; He came, and appeared in good humour as
usual, but I thought his countenance was much cast down.&nbsp; I
rallied him, and desired him to give me his staff, which he did:
I told him, if he would secure it me a week, I would set all
right: he asked how; I said I would immediately turn Lord
Marlborough, his two daughters, <a name="citation357a"></a><a
href="#footnote357a" class="citation">[357a]</a> the Duke and
Duchess of Somerset, and Lord Cholmondeley, <a
name="citation357b"></a><a href="#footnote357b"
class="citation">[357b]</a> out of all their employments; and I
believe he had not a friend but was of my opinion.&nbsp;
Arbuthnot asked how he came not to secure a majority.&nbsp; He
could answer nothing but that he could not help it, if people
would lie and forswear.&nbsp; A poor answer for a great
Minister.&nbsp; There fell from him a Scripture expression, that
&ldquo;the hearts of kings are unsearchable.&rdquo; <a
name="citation357c"></a><a href="#footnote357c"
class="citation">[357c]</a>&nbsp; I told him it was what I
feared, and was from him the worst news he could tell me.&nbsp; I
begged him to know what he had to trust to: he stuck a little;
but at last bid me not fear, for all would be well yet.&nbsp; We
would fain have had him eat a bit where he was, but he would go
home, it was past six: he made me go home with him.&nbsp; There
we found his brother and Mr. Secretary.&nbsp; He made his son
take a list of all in the House of Commons who had places, and
yet voted against the Court, in such a manner as if they should
lose their places: I doubt he is not able to compass it.&nbsp;
Lord Keeper came in an hour, and they were going upon
business.&nbsp; So I left him, and returned to Mrs. Masham; but
she had company with her, and I would not stay.&mdash;This is a
long journal, and of a day that may produce great alterations,
and hazard the ruin of England.&nbsp; The Whigs are all in
triumph; they foretold how all this would be, but we thought it
boasting.&nbsp; Nay, they said the Parliament should be dissolved
before Christmas, and perhaps it may: this is all your d&mdash;d
Duchess of <a name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
358</span>Somerset&rsquo;s doings.&nbsp; I warned them of it nine
months ago, and a hundred times since: the Secretary always
dreaded it.&nbsp; I told Lord Treasurer I should have the
advantage of him; for he would lose his head, and I should only
be hanged, and so carry my body entire to the grave.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; I was this morning with Mr. Secretary: we are both of
opinion that the Queen is false.&nbsp; I told him what I heard,
and he confirmed it by other circumstances.&nbsp; I then went to
my friend Lewis, who had sent to see me.&nbsp; He talks of
nothing but retiring to his estate in Wales.&nbsp; He gave me
reasons to believe the whole matter is settled between the Queen
and the Whigs; he hears that Lord Somers is to be Treasurer, and
believes that, sooner than turn out the Duchess of Somerset, she
will dissolve the Parliament, and get a Whiggish one, which may
be done by managing elections.&nbsp; Things are now in the
crisis, and a day or two will determine.&nbsp; I have desired him
to engage Lord Treasurer that as soon as he finds the change is
resolved on, he will send me abroad as Queen&rsquo;s Secretary
somewhere or other, where I may remain till the new Ministers
recall me; and then I will be sick for five or six months, till
the storm has spent itself.&nbsp; I hope he will grant me this;
for I should hardly trust myself to the mercy of my enemies while
their anger is fresh.&nbsp; I dined to-day with the Secretary,
who affects mirth, and seems to hope all will yet be well.&nbsp;
I took him aside after dinner, told him how I had served them,
and had asked no reward, but thought I might ask security; and
then desired the same thing of him, to send me abroad before a
change.&nbsp; He embraced me, and swore he would take the same
care of me as himself, etc., but bid me have courage, for that in
two days my Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s wisdom would appear greater
than ever; that he suffered all that had happened on purpose, and
had taken measures to turn it to advantage.&nbsp; I said,
&ldquo;God send it&rdquo;; but I do not believe a syllable; and,
as far as I can judge, the game is lost.&nbsp; I shall know more
soon, and my letters will at least be a good history to show you
the steps of this change.</p>
<p><a name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
359</span>10.&nbsp; I was this morning with Lewis, who thinks
they will let the Parliament sit till they have given the money,
and then dissolve them in spring, and break the Ministry.&nbsp;
He spoke to Lord Treasurer about what I desired him.&nbsp; My
lord desired him with great earnestness to assure me that all
would be well, and that I should fear nothing.&nbsp; I dined in
the City with a friend.&nbsp; This day the Commons went to the
Queen with their address, and all the Lords who were for the
peace went with them, to show their zeal.&nbsp; I have now some
further conviction that the Queen is false, and it begins to be
known.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; I went between two and three to see Mrs. Masham;
while I was there she went to her bed-chamber to try a
petticoat.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer came in to see her, and seeing me
in the outer room, fell a rallying me: says he, &ldquo;You had
better keep company with me, than with such a fellow as Lewis,
who has not the soul of a chicken, nor the heart of a
mite.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he went in to Mrs. Masham, and as he came
back desired her leave to let me go home with him to
dinner.&nbsp; He asked whether I was not afraid to be seen with
him.&nbsp; I said I never valued my Lord Treasurer in my life,
and therefore should have always the same esteem for Mr. Harley
and Lord Oxford.&nbsp; He seemed to talk confidently, as if he
reckoned that all this would turn to advantage.&nbsp; I could not
forbear hinting that he was not sure of the Queen, and that those
scoundrel, starving lords would never have dared to vote against
the Court, if Somerset had not assured them that it would please
the Queen.&nbsp; He said that was true, and Somerset did
so.&nbsp; I stayed till six; then De Buys, the Dutch Envoy, came
to him, and I left him.&nbsp; Prior was with us a while after
dinner.&nbsp; I see him and all of them cast down, though they
make the best of it.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; Ford is come to town; I saw him last night: he is in
no fear, but sanguine, although I have told him the state of
things.&nbsp; This change so resembles the last, that I wonder
they do not observe it.&nbsp; The Secretary sent for me yesterday
to dine with him, but I was abroad; I hope he had something <a
name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 360</span>to say to
me.&nbsp; This is morning, and I write in bed.&nbsp; I am going
to the Duke of Ormond, whom I have not yet seen.&nbsp; Morrow,
sirrahs.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; I was to see the Duke of Ormond
this morning: he asked me two or three questions after his civil
way, and they related to Ireland: at last I told him that, from
the time I had seen him, I never once thought of Irish
affairs.&nbsp; He whispered me that he hoped I had done some good
things here: I said, if everybody else had done half as much, we
should not be as we are: then we went aside, and talked over
affairs.&nbsp; I told him how all things stood, and advised him
what was to be done.&nbsp; I then went and sat an hour with the
Duchess; then as long with Lady Oglethorpe, <a
name="citation360a"></a><a href="#footnote360a"
class="citation">[360a]</a> who is so cunning a devil that I
believe she could yet find a remedy, if they would take her
advice.&nbsp; I dined with a friend at Court.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; I was this morning with the Secretary: he will needs
pretend to talk as if things would be well: &ldquo;Will you
believe it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you see these people turned
out?&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, yes, if I saw the Duke and Duchess of
Somerset out: he swore if they were not, he would give up his
place.&nbsp; Our Society dined to-day at Sir William
Wyndham&rsquo;s; we were thirteen present.&nbsp; Lord Orrery and
two other members were introduced: I left them at seven.&nbsp; I
forgot to tell you that the printer told me yesterday that
Morphew, the publisher, was sent for by that Lord Chief-Justice,
<a name="citation360b"></a><a href="#footnote360b"
class="citation">[360b]</a> who was a manager against
Sacheverell; he showed him two or three papers and pamphlets;
among the rest mine of the <i>Conduct of the Allies</i>,
threatened him, asked who was the author, and has bound him over
to appear next term.&nbsp; He would not have the impudence to do
this, if he did not foresee what was coming at Court.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; Lord Shelburne was with me this morning, to be
informed of the state of affairs, and desired I would answer all
his objections against a peace, which was soon done, for <a
name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 361</span>he would
not give me room to put in a word.&nbsp; He is a man of good
sense enough; but argues so violently, that he will some day or
other put himself into a consumption.&nbsp; He desires that he
may not be denied when he comes to see me, which I promised, but
will not perform.&nbsp; Leigh and Sterne set out for Ireland on
Monday se&rsquo;nnight: I suppose they will be with you long
before this.&mdash;I was to-night drinking very good wine in
scurvy company, at least some of them; I was drawn in, but will
be more cautious for the future; &rsquo;tis late, etc.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; They say the Occasional Bill <a
name="citation361"></a><a href="#footnote361"
class="citation">[361]</a> is brought to-day into the House of
Lords; but I know not.&nbsp; I will now put an end to my letter,
and give it into the post-house myself.&nbsp; This will be a
memorable letter, and I shall sigh to see it some years
hence.&nbsp; Here are the first steps toward the ruin of an
excellent Ministry; for I look upon them as certainly ruined; and
God knows what may be the consequences.&mdash;I now bid my
dearest MD farewell; for company is coming, and I must be at Lord
Dartmouth&rsquo;s office by noon.&nbsp; Farewell, dearest MD; I
wish you a merry Christmas; I believe you will have this about
that time.&nbsp; Love Presto, who loves MD above all things a
thousand times.&nbsp; Farewell again, dearest MD, etc.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXXVII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Dec.</i> 15, 1711.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">put</span> in my letter this evening
myself.&nbsp; I was to-day inquiring at the Secretary&rsquo;s
office of Mr. Lewis how things went: I there met Prior, who told
me he gave all for gone, etc., and was of opinion the whole
Ministry would give up their places next week: Lewis thinks they
will not till spring, when the session is over; both of them
entirely despair.&nbsp; I went to see Mrs. Masham, who invited me
to dinner; but I was engaged to Lewis.&nbsp; At four I went to
Masham&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He came and whispered me that he had it
from a very good hand that all would be well, and I found them
both very <a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
362</span>cheerful.&nbsp; The company was going to the opera, but
desired I would come and sup with them.&nbsp; I did so at ten,
and Lord Treasurer was there, and sat with us till past twelve,
and was more cheerful than I have seen him these ten days.&nbsp;
Mrs. Masham told me he was mightily cast down some days ago, and
he could not indeed hide it from me.&nbsp; Arbuthnot is in good
hopes that the Queen has not betrayed us, but only has been
frightened, and flattered, etc.&nbsp; But I cannot yet be of his
opinion, whether my reasons are better, or that my fears are
greater.&nbsp; I do resolve, if they give up, or are turned out
soon, to retire for some months, and I have pitched upon the
place already: but I will take methods for hearing from MD, and
writing to them.&nbsp; But I would be out of the way upon the
first of the ferment; for they lay all things on me, even some I
have never read.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; I took courage to-day, and went to Court with a very
cheerful countenance.&nbsp; It was mightily crowded; both parties
coming to observe each other&rsquo;s faces.&nbsp; I have avoided
Lord Halifax&rsquo;s bow till he forced it on me; but we did not
talk together.&nbsp; I could not make less than fourscore bows,
of which about twenty might be to Whigs.&nbsp; The Duke of
Somerset is gone to Petworth, and, I hear, the Duchess too, of
which I shall be very glad.&nbsp; Prince Eugene, <a
name="citation362"></a><a href="#footnote362"
class="citation">[362]</a> who was expected here some days ago,
we are now told, will not come at all.&nbsp; The Whigs designed
to have met him with forty thousand horse.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer
told me some days ago of his discourse with the Emperor&rsquo;s
Resident, that puppy Hoffman, about Prince Eugene&rsquo;s coming;
by which I found my lord would hinder it, if he could; and we
shall be all glad if he does not come, and think it a good point
gained.&nbsp; Sir Andrew Fountaine, Ford, and I dined to-day with
Mrs. Van, by invitation.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; I have mistaken the day of the month, and been
forced to mend it thrice.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Mr. Masham <a
name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>and his
lady, by invitation.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer was to be there, but
came not.&nbsp; It was to entertain Buys, the Dutch Envoy, who
speaks English well enough: he was plaguily politic, telling a
thousand lies, of which none passed upon any of us.&nbsp; We are
still in the condition of suspense, and I think have little
hopes.&nbsp; The Duchess of Somerset is not gone to Petworth;
only the Duke, and that is a poor sacrifice.&nbsp; I believe the
Queen certainly designs to change the Ministry, but perhaps may
put it off till the session is over: and I think they had better
give up now, if she will not deal openly; and then they need not
answer for the consequences of a peace, when it is in other
hands, and may yet be broken.&nbsp; They say my Lord Privy Seal
sets out for Holland this week: so the peace goes on.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; It has rained hard from morning till night, and cost
me three shillings in coach-hire.&nbsp; We have had abundance of
wet weather.&nbsp; I dined in the City, and was with the printer,
who has now a fifth edition of the <i>Conduct</i>, etc.: it is in
small, and sold for sixpence; they have printed as many as three
editions, because they are to be sent in numbers into the country
by great men, etc., who subscribe for hundreds.&nbsp; It has been
sent a fortnight ago to Ireland: I suppose you will print it
there.&nbsp; The Tory Lords and Commons in Parliament argue all
from it; and all agree that never anything of that kind was of so
great consequence, or made so many converts.&nbsp; By the time I
have sent this letter, I expect to hear from little MD: it will
be a month, two days hence, since I had your last, and I will
allow ten days for accidents.&nbsp; I cannot get rid of the
leavings of a cold I got a month ago, or else it is a new
one.&nbsp; I have been writing letters all this evening till I am
weary, and I am sending out another little thing, which I hope to
finish this week, and design to send to the printer in an unknown
hand.&nbsp; There was printed a Grub Street speech of Lord
Nottingham; <a name="citation363"></a><a href="#footnote363"
class="citation">[363]</a> and he was such an owl to complain of
it in the House of Lords, who have <a name="page364"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 364</span>taken up the printer for it.&nbsp; I
heard at Court that Walpole <a name="citation364a"></a><a
href="#footnote364a" class="citation">[364a]</a> (a great Whig
member) said that I and my whimsical Club writ it at one of our
meetings, and that I should pay for it.&nbsp; He will find he
lies: and I shall let him know by a third hand my thoughts of
him.&nbsp; He is to be Secretary of State, if the Ministry
changes; but he has lately had a bribe proved against him in
Parliament, while he was Secretary at War.&nbsp; He is one of the
Whigs&rsquo; chief speakers.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; Sad dismal weather.&nbsp; I went to the
Secretary&rsquo;s office, and Lewis made me dine with him.&nbsp;
I intended to have dined with Lord Treasurer.&nbsp; I have not
seen the Secretary this week.&nbsp; Things do not mend at
all.&nbsp; Lord Dartmouth despairs, and is for giving up; Lewis
is of the same mind; but Lord Treasurer only says, &ldquo;Poh,
poh, all will be well.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am come home early to
finish something I am doing; but I find I want heart and humour,
and would read any idle book that came in my way.&nbsp; I have
just sent away a penny paper to make a little mischief.&nbsp;
Patrick is gone to the burial of an Irish footman, who was Dr.
King&rsquo;s <a name="citation364b"></a><a href="#footnote364b"
class="citation">[364b]</a> servant; he died of a consumption, a
fit death for a poor starving wit&rsquo;s footman.&nbsp; The
Irish servants always club to bury a countryman.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; I was with the Secretary this morning, and, for
aught I can see, we shall have a languishing death: I can know
nothing, nor themselves neither.&nbsp; I dined, you know, with
our Society, and that odious Secretary would make me President
next week; so I must entertain them this day se&rsquo;nnight at
the Thatched House Tavern, <a name="citation364c"></a><a
href="#footnote364c" class="citation">[364c]</a> where we dined
<a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>to-day:
it will cost me five or six pounds; yet the Secretary says he
will give me wine.&nbsp; I found a letter when I came home from
the Bishop of Clogher.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; This is the first time I ever got a new cold before
the old one was going: it came yesterday, and appeared in all due
forms, eyes and nose running, etc., and is now very bad; and I
cannot tell how I got it.&nbsp; Sir Andrew Fountaine and I were
invited to dine with Mrs. Van.&nbsp; I was this morning with the
Duke of Ormond; and neither he nor I can think of anything to
comfort us in present affairs.&nbsp; We must certainly fall, if
the Duchess of Somerset be not turned out; and nobody believes
the Queen will ever part with her.&nbsp; The Duke and I were
settling when Mr. Secretary and I should dine with him, and he
fixes upon Tuesday; and when I came away I remembered it was
Christmas Day.&nbsp; I was to see Lady &mdash;, who is just up
after lying-in; and the ugliest sight I have seen, pale, dead,
old and yellow, for want of her paint.&nbsp; She has turned my
stomach.&nbsp; But she will soon be painted, and a beauty
again.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; I find myself disordered with a pain all round the
small of my back, which I imputed to champagne I had drunk; but
find it to have been only my new cold.&nbsp; It was a fine frosty
day, and I resolved to walk into the City.&nbsp; I called at Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s at eleven, and stayed some time with
him.&mdash;He showed me a letter from a great Presbyterian parson
<a name="citation365"></a><a href="#footnote365"
class="citation">[365]</a> to him, complaining how their friends
had betrayed them by passing this Conformity Bill; and he showed
me the answer he had written, which his friends would not let him
send; but was a very good one.&nbsp; He is very cheerful; but
gives one no hopes, nor has any to give.&nbsp; I went into the
City, and there I dined.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; As I was dressing to go to church, a
friend that was to see me advised me not to stir out; so I shall
keep at home to-day, and only eat some broth, if I can get
it.&nbsp; It is a terrible cold frost, and snow fell yesterday,
which <a name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
366</span>still remains: look there, you may see it from the
penthouses.&nbsp; The Lords made yesterday two or three votes
about peace, and Hanover, of a very angry kind to vex the
Ministry, and they will meet sooner by a fortnight than the
Commons; and they say, are preparing some knocking
addresses.&nbsp; Morrow, sirrahs.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll sit at home,
and when I go to bed I will tell you how I am.&mdash;I have sat
at home all day, and eaten only a mess of broth and a roll.&nbsp;
I have written a <i>Prophecy</i>, <a name="citation366a"></a><a
href="#footnote366a" class="citation">[366a]</a> which I design
to print; I did it to-day, and some other verses.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; I went into the City to-day in a coach, and dined
there.&nbsp; My cold is going.&nbsp; It is now bitter hard frost,
and has been so these three or four days.&nbsp; My
<i>Prophecy</i> is printed, and will be published after Christmas
Day; I like it mightily: I don&rsquo;t know how it will
pass.&nbsp; You will never understand it at your distance,
without help.&nbsp; I believe everybody will guess it to be mine,
because it is somewhat in the same manner with that of
&ldquo;Merlin&rdquo; <a name="citation366b"></a><a
href="#footnote366b" class="citation">[366b]</a> in the
<i>Miscellanies</i>.&nbsp; My Lord Privy Seal set out this day
for Holland: he&rsquo;ll have a cold journey.&nbsp; I gave
Patrick half a crown for his Christmas box, on condition he would
be good, and he came home drunk at midnight.&nbsp; I have taken a
memorandum of it, because I never design to give him a groat
more.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis cruel cold.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; I wish MD a merry Christmas, and many a one; but
mine is melancholy: I durst not go to church to-day, finding
myself a little out of order, and it snowing prodigiously, and
freezing.&nbsp; At noon I went to Mrs. Van, who had this week
engaged me to dine there to-day: and there I received the news
that poor Mrs. Long <a name="citation366c"></a><a
href="#footnote366c" class="citation">[366c]</a> died at Lynn in
Norfolk on Saturday last, at four in the morning: she was sick
but four hours.&nbsp; We suppose it was the asthma, which she was
subject to as well as the dropsy, as she sent me word in her last
letter, <a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
367</span>written about five weeks ago; but then said she was
recovered.&nbsp; I never was more afflicted at any death.&nbsp;
The poor creature had retired to Lynn two years ago, to live
cheap, and pay her debts.&nbsp; In her last letter she told me
she hoped to be easy by Christmas; and she kept her word,
although she meant it otherwise.&nbsp; She had all sorts of
amiable qualities, and no ill ones, but the indiscretion of too
much neglecting her own affairs.&nbsp; She had two thousand
pounds left her by an old grandmother, <a
name="citation367a"></a><a href="#footnote367a"
class="citation">[367a]</a> with which she intended to pay her
debts, and live on an annuity she had of one hundred pounds a
year, and Newburg House, which would be about sixty pounds
more.&nbsp; That odious grandmother living so long, forced her to
retire; for the two thousand pounds was settled on her after the
old woman&rsquo;s death, yet her brute of a brother, Sir James
Long, <a name="citation367b"></a><a href="#footnote367b"
class="citation">[367b]</a> would not advance it for her; else
she might have paid her debts, and continued here, and lived
still: I believe melancholy helped her on to her grave.&nbsp; I
have ordered a paragraph to be put in the <i>Postboy</i>, <a
name="citation367c"></a><a href="#footnote367c"
class="citation">[367c]</a> giving an account of her death, and
making honourable mention of her; which is all I can do to serve
her memory: but one reason was spite; for her brother would fain
have her death a secret, to save the charge of bringing her up
here to bury her, or going into mourning.&nbsp; Pardon all this,
for the sake of a poor creature I had so much friendship for.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; I went to Mr. Secretary this morning, and he would
have me dine with him.&nbsp; I called at noon at Mrs.
Masham&rsquo;s, who desired me not to let the <i>Prophecy</i> be
published, for fear of angering the Queen about the Duchess of
Somerset; so I writ to the printer to stop them.&nbsp; They have
been printed and given about, but not sold.&nbsp; I saw Lord
Treasurer there, who had been two hours with the Queen; and Mrs.
Masham is in hopes things will do well again.&nbsp; <a
name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 368</span>I went at
night again, and supped at Mr. Masham&rsquo;s, and Lord Treasurer
sat with us till one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; So &rsquo;tis late,
etc.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; I entertained our Society at the Thatched House
Tavern to-day at dinner; but brother Bathurst sent for wine, the
house affording none.&nbsp; The printer had not received my
letter, and so he brought up dozens apiece of the
<i>Prophecy</i>; but I ordered him to part with no more.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis an admirable good one, and people are mad for
it.&nbsp; The frost still continues violently cold.&nbsp; Mrs.
Masham invited me to come to-night and play at cards; but our
Society did not part till nine.&nbsp; But I supped with Mrs.
Hill, her sister, and there was Mrs. Masham and Lord Treasurer,
and we stayed till twelve.&nbsp; He is endeavouring to get a
majority against next Wednesday, when the House of Lords is to
meet, and the Whigs intend to make some violent addresses against
a peace, if not prevented.&nbsp; God knows what will become of
us.&mdash;It is still prodigiously cold; but so I told you
already.&nbsp; We have eggs on the spit, I wish they may not be
addled.&nbsp; When I came home to-night I found, forsooth, a
letter from MD, N. 24, 24, 24, 24; there, do you know the numbers
now? and at the same time one from Joe, <a
name="citation368a"></a><a href="#footnote368a"
class="citation">[368a]</a> full of thanks: let him know I have
received it, and am glad of his success, but won&rsquo;t put him
to the charge of a letter.&nbsp; I had a letter some time ago
from Mr. Warburton, <a name="citation368b"></a><a
href="#footnote368b" class="citation">[368b]</a> and I beg one of
you will copy out what I shall tell you, and send it by some
opportunity to Warburton.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as follows: The Doctor
has received Mr. Warburton&rsquo;s letter, and desires he will
let the Doctor know where <a name="citation368c"></a><a
href="#footnote368c" class="citation">[368c]</a> that accident he
mentions is like soon to happen, and he will do what he can in
it.&mdash;And pray, madam, let them know that I do this to save
myself the trouble, and them the expense of a letter.&nbsp; And I
think that this is enough for one that comes home at twelve from
a Lord Treasurer and Mrs. Masham.&nbsp; Oh, I could tell you ten
thousand things of our mad politics, <a name="page369"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 369</span>upon what small circumstances great
affairs have turned.&nbsp; But I will go rest my busy head.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; I was this morning with brother Bathurst to see the
Duke of Ormond.&nbsp; We have given his Grace some hopes to be
one of our Society.&nbsp; The Secretary and I and Bathurst are to
dine with him on Sunday next.&nbsp; The Duke is not in much
hopes, but has been very busy in endeavouring to bring over some
lords against next Wednesday.&nbsp; The Duchess caught me as I
was going out; she is sadly in fear about things, and blames me
for not mending them by my credit with Lord Treasurer; and I
blame her.&nbsp; She met me in the street at noon, and engaged me
to dine with her, which I did; and we talked an hour after dinner
in her closet.&nbsp; If we miscarry on Wednesday, I believe it
will be by some strange sort of neglect.&nbsp; They talk of
making eight new lords by calling up some peers&rsquo; eldest
sons; but they delay strangely.&nbsp; I saw Judge Coote <a
name="citation369a"></a><a href="#footnote369a"
class="citation">[369a]</a> to-day at the Duke of Ormond&rsquo;s:
he desires to come and see me, to justify his principles.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; This goes to-day.&nbsp; I will not
answer yours, your 24th, till next, which shall begin to-night,
as usual.&nbsp; Lord Shelburne has sent to invite me to dinner,
but I am engaged with Lewis at Ned Southwell&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Lord
Northampton and Lord Aylesbury&rsquo;s sons <a
name="citation369b"></a><a href="#footnote369b"
class="citation">[369b]</a> are both made peers; but we shall
want more.&nbsp; I write this post to your Dean.&nbsp; I owe the
Archbishop a letter this long time.&nbsp; All people that come
from Ireland complain of him, and scold me for protecting
him.&nbsp; Pray, Madam Dingley, let me know what Presto has
received for this year, or whether anything is due to him for
last: I cannot look over your former letters now.&nbsp; As for
Dingley&rsquo;s own account of her exchequer money, I will give
it on t&rsquo;other side.&nbsp; Farewell, my own dearest MD, and
love Presto; and God ever bless dearest MD, etc. etc.&nbsp; I
wish you many happy Christmases and new years.</p>

<p>Saturday night.&nbsp; I have broke open my letter, and tore it
into the bargain, to let you know that we are all safe: the Queen
has made no less than twelve lords, <a name="citation370"></a><a
href="#footnote370" class="citation">[370]</a> to have a
majority; nine new ones, the other three peers&rsquo; sons; and
has turned out the Duke of Somerset.&nbsp; She is awaked at last,
and so is Lord Treasurer: I want nothing now but to see the
Duchess out.&nbsp; But we shall do without her.&nbsp; We are all
extremely happy.&nbsp; Give me joy, sirrahs.&nbsp; This is
written in a coffee-house.&nbsp; Three of the new lords are of
our Society.</p>

371</span>LETTER XXXVIII.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Dec.</i> 29, 1711.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">put</span> my letter in this evening,
after coming from dinner at Ned Southwell&rsquo;s, where I drank
very good Irish wine, and we are in great joy at this happy turn
of affairs.&nbsp; The Queen has been at last persuaded to her own
interest and security, and I freely think she must have made both
herself and kingdom very unhappy, if she had done
otherwise.&nbsp; It is still a mighty secret that Masham is to be
one of the new lords; they say he does not yet know it himself;
but the Queen is to surprise him with it.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary
will be a lord at the end of the session; but they want him still
in Parliament.&nbsp; After all, it is a strange unhappy necessity
of making so many peers together; but the Queen has drawn it upon
herself, by her confounded trimming and moderation.&nbsp; Three,
as I told you, are of our Society.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; I writ the Dean and you a lie yesterday; for the
Duke of Somerset is not yet turned out.&nbsp; I was to-day at
Court, and resolved to be very civil to the Whigs; but saw few
there.&nbsp; When I was in the bed-chamber talking to Lord
Rochester, he went up to Lady Burlington, <a
name="citation371a"></a><a href="#footnote371a"
class="citation">[371a]</a> who asked him who I was; and Lady
Sunderland and she whispered about me: I desired Lord Rochester
to tell Lady Sunderland I doubted she was not as much in love
with me as I was with her; but he would not deliver my
message.&nbsp; The Duchess of Shrewsbury came running up to me,
and clapped her fan up to hide us from the company, and we gave
one another joy of this change; but sighed when we reflected on
the Somerset family not being out.&nbsp; The Secretary and I, and
brother Bathurst, and Lord Windsor, dined with the Duke of
Ormond.&nbsp; Bathurst and Windsor <a name="citation371b"></a><a
href="#footnote371b" class="citation">[371b]</a> are to be two of
the <a name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 372</span>new
lords.&nbsp; I desired my Lord Radnor&rsquo;s brother, <a
name="citation372a"></a><a href="#footnote372a"
class="citation">[372a]</a> at Court to-day, to let my lord know
I would call on him at six, which I did, and was arguing with him
three hours to bring him over to us, and I spoke so closely that
I believe he will be tractable; but he is a scoundrel, and though
I said I only talked for my love to him, I told a lie; for I did
not care if he were hanged: but everyone gained over is of
consequence.&nbsp; The Duke of Marlborough was at Court to-day,
and nobody hardly took notice of him.&nbsp; Masham&rsquo;s being
a lord begins to take wind: nothing at Court can be kept a
secret.&nbsp; Wednesday will be a great day: you shall know
more.</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; Our frost is broken since yesterday, and it is very
slabbery; <a name="citation372b"></a><a href="#footnote372b"
class="citation">[372b]</a> yet I walked to the City and dined,
and ordered some things with the printer.&nbsp; I have settled
Dr. King in the Gazette; it will be worth two hundred pounds a
year to him.&nbsp; Our new lords&rsquo; patents are passed: I
don&rsquo;t like the expedient, if we could have found any
other.&nbsp; I see I have said this before.&nbsp; I hear the Duke
of Marlborough is turned out of all his employments: I shall know
to-morrow when I am to carry Dr. King to dine with the
Secretary.&mdash;These are strong remedies; pray God the patient
is able to bear them.&nbsp; The last Ministry people are utterly
desperate.</p>
<p>Jan. 1.&nbsp; Now I wish my dearest little MD many happy new
years; yes, both Dingley and Stella, ay and Presto too, many
happy new years.&nbsp; I dined with the Secretary, and it is true
that the Duke of Marlborough is turned out of all.&nbsp; The Duke
of Ormond has got his regiment of foot-guards, I know not who has
the rest. If the Ministry be not sure of a peace, I shall wonder
at this step, and do not approve it at best. The Queen and Lord
Treasurer mortally hate the Duke of Marlborough, and to that he
owes his fall, more <a name="page373"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 373</span>than to his other faults: unless he
has been tampering too far with his party, of which I have not
heard any particulars; however it be, the world abroad will blame
us.&nbsp; I confess my belief that he has not one good quality in
the world beside that of a general, and even that I have heard
denied by several great soldiers.&nbsp; But we have had constant
success in arms while he commanded.&nbsp; Opinion is a mighty
matter in war, and I doubt the French think it impossible to
conquer an army that he leads, and our soldiers think the same;
and how far even this step may encourage the French to play
tricks with us, no man knows.&nbsp; I do not love to see personal
resentment mix with public affairs.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; This being the day the Lords meet, and the new peers
to be introduced, I went to Westminster to see the sight; but the
crowd was too great in the house.&nbsp; So I only went into the
robing-room, to give my four brothers joy, and Sir Thomas Mansel,
<a name="citation373"></a><a href="#footnote373"
class="citation">[373]</a> and Lord Windsor; the other six I am
not acquainted with.&nbsp; It was apprehended the Whigs would
have raised some difficulties, but nothing happened.&nbsp; I went
to see Lady Masham at noon, and wish her joy of her new honour,
and a happy new year.&nbsp; I found her very well pleased; for
peerage will be some sort of protection to her upon any turn of
affairs.&nbsp; She engaged me to come at night, and sup with her
and Lord Treasurer: I went at nine, and she was not at home, so I
would not stay.&mdash;No, no, I won&rsquo;t answer your letter
yet, young women.&nbsp; I dined with a friend in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; I see nothing here like Christmas, except
brawn or mince-pies in places where I dine, and giving away my
half-crowns like farthings to great men&rsquo;s porters and
butlers.&nbsp; Yesterday I paid seven good guineas to the fellow
at the tavern where I treated the Society.&nbsp; I have a great
mind to send you the bill.&nbsp; I think I told you some
articles.&nbsp; I have not heard whether anything was done in the
House of Lords after introducing the new ones.&nbsp; Ford has
been sitting with me till peeast tweeleve a clock.</p>
<p><a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
374</span>3.&nbsp; This was our Society day: Lord Dupplin was
President; we choose every week; the last President treats and
chooses his successor.&nbsp; I believe our dinner cost fifteen
pounds beside wine.&nbsp; The Secretary grew brisk, and would not
let me go, nor Lord Lansdowne, <a name="citation374a"></a><a
href="#footnote374a" class="citation">[374a]</a> who would fain
have gone home to his lady, being newly married to Lady Mary
Thynne.&nbsp; It was near one when we parted, so you must think I
cannot write much to-night.&nbsp; The adjourning of the House of
Lords yesterday, as the Queen desired, was just carried by the
twelve new lords, and one more.&nbsp; Lord Radnor was not there:
I hope I have cured him.&nbsp; Did I tell you that I have brought
Dr. King in to be Gazetteer?&nbsp; It will be worth above two
hundred pounds a year to him: I believe I told you so before, but
I am forgetful.&nbsp; Go, get you gone to ombre, and claret, and
toasted oranges.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go sleep.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I cannot get rid of the leavings of my cold.&nbsp; I
was in the City to-day, and dined with my printer, and gave him a
ballad made by several hands, I know not whom.&nbsp; I believe
Lord Treasurer had a finger in it; I added three stanzas; I
suppose Dr. Arbuthnot had the greatest share.&nbsp; I had been
overseeing some other little prints, and a pamphlet made by one
of my under-strappers.&nbsp; Somerset is not out yet.&nbsp; I
doubt not but you will have the <i>Prophecy</i> in Ireland,
although it is not published here, only printed copies given to
friends.&nbsp; Tell me, do you understand it?&nbsp; No, faith,
not without help.&nbsp; Tell me what you stick at, and I&rsquo;ll
explain.&nbsp; We turned out a member of our Society yesterday
for gross neglect and non-attendance.&nbsp; I writ to him by
order to give him notice of it.&nbsp; It is Tom Harley, <a
name="citation374b"></a><a href="#footnote374b"
class="citation">[374b]</a> secretary to the Treasurer, and
cousin-german to Lord Treasurer.&nbsp; He is going to Hanover
from the Queen.&nbsp; I am <a name="page375"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 375</span>to give the Duke of Ormond notice of
his election as soon as I can see him.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I went this morning with a parishioner of mine, one
Nuttal, who came over here for a legacy of one hundred pounds,
and a roguish lawyer had refused to pay him, and would not
believe he was the man.&nbsp; I writ to the lawyer a sharp
letter, that I had taken Nuttal into my protection, and was
resolved to stand by him, and the next news was, that the lawyer
desired I would meet him, and attest he was the man, which I did,
and his money was paid upon the spot.&nbsp; I then visited Lord
Treasurer, who is now right again, and all well, only that the
Somerset family is not out yet.&nbsp; I hate that; I don&rsquo;t
like it, as the man said, by, etc.&nbsp; Then I went and visited
poor Will Congreve, who had a French fellow tampering with one of
his eyes; he is almost blind of both.&nbsp; I dined with some
merchants in the City, but could not see Stratford, with whom I
had business.&nbsp; Presto, leave off your impertinence, and
answer our letter, saith MD.&nbsp; Yes, yes, one of these days,
when I have nothing else to do.&nbsp; O, faith, this letter is a
week written, and not one side done yet. These ugly spots are not
tobacco, but this is the last gilt sheet I have of large paper,
therefore hold your tongue.&nbsp; Nuttal was surprised when they
gave him bits of paper instead of money, but I made Ben Tooke put
him in his geers: <a name="citation375"></a><a
href="#footnote375" class="citation">[375]</a> he could not
reckon ten pounds, but was puzzled with the Irish way.&nbsp; Ben
Tooke and my printer have desired me to make them stationers to
the Ordnance, of which Lord Rivers is Master, instead of the Duke
of Marlborough.&nbsp; It will be a hundred pounds a year apiece
to them, if I can get it.&nbsp; I will try to-morrow.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I went this morning to Earl Rivers, gave him joy of
his new employment, and desired him to prefer my printer and
bookseller to be stationers to his office.&nbsp; He immediately
granted it me; but, like an old courtier, told me it was wholly
on my account, but that he heard I had intended to engage Mr.
Secretary to speak to him, and desired I would <a
name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 376</span>engage him
to do so, but that, however, he did it only for my sake.&nbsp;
This is a Court trick, to oblige as many as you can at
once.&nbsp; I read prayers to poor Mrs. Wesley, who is very much
out of order, instead of going to church; and then I went to
Court, which I found very full, in expectation of seeing Prince
Eugene, who landed last night, and lies at Leicester House; he
was not to see the Queen till six this evening.&nbsp; I hope and
believe he comes too late to do the Whigs any good.&nbsp; I
refused dining with the Secretary, and was like to lose my
dinner, which was at a private acquaintance&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I went
at six to see the Prince at Court, but he was gone in to the
Queen; and when he came out, Mr. Secretary, who introduced him,
walked so near him that he quite screened me from him with his
great periwig.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you a good passage: as
Prince Eugene was going with Mr. Secretary to Court, he told the
Secretary that Hoffman, the Emperor&rsquo;s Resident, said to His
Highness that it was not proper to go to Court without a long
wig, and his was a tied-up one: &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says the
Prince, &ldquo;I knew not what to do, for I never had a long
periwig in my life; and I have sent to all my valets and footmen,
to see whether any of them have one, that I might borrow it, but
none of them has any.&rdquo;&mdash;Was not this spoken very
greatly with some sort of contempt?&nbsp; But the Secretary said
it was a thing of no consequence, and only observed by gentlemen
ushers.&nbsp; I supped with Lord Masham, where Lord Treasurer and
Mr. Secretary supped with us: the first left us at twelve, but
the rest did not part till two, yet I have written all this,
because it is fresh: and now I&rsquo;ll go sleep if I can; that
is, I believe I shall, because I have drank a little.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; I was this morning to give the Duke of Ormond notice
of the honour done him to make him one of our Society, and to
invite him on Thursday next to the Thatched House: he has
accepted it with the gratitude and humility such a preferment
deserves, but cannot come till the next meeting, because Prince
Eugene is to dine with him that day, which I allowed for: a good
excuse, and will report accordingly.&nbsp; I dined with Lord
Masham, and sat there till eight this evening, and came <a
name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 377</span>home,
because I was not very well, but a little griped; but now I am
well again, I will not go, at least but very seldom, to Lord
Masham&rsquo;s suppers.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer is generally there,
and that tempts me, but late sitting up does not agree with me:
there&rsquo;s the short and the long, and I won&rsquo;t do it; so
take your answer, dear little young women; and I have no more to
say to you to-night, because of the Archbishop, for I am going to
write a long letter to him, but not so politely as formerly: I
won&rsquo;t trust him.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Well, then, come, let us see this letter; if I must
answer it, I must.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s here now? yes, faith, I
lamented my birthday <a name="citation377a"></a><a
href="#footnote377a" class="citation">[377a]</a> two days after,
and that&rsquo;s all: and you rhyme, Madam Stella; were those
verses made upon my birthday? faith, when I read them, I had them
running in my head all the day, and said them over a thousand
times; they drank your health in all their glasses, and wished,
etc.&nbsp; I could not get them out of my head.&nbsp; What? no, I
believe it was not; what do I say upon the eighth of
December?&nbsp; Compare, and see whether I say so.&nbsp; I am
glad of Mrs. Stoyte&rsquo;s recovery, heartily glad; your Dolly
Manley&rsquo;s and Bishop of Cloyne&rsquo;s <a
name="citation377b"></a><a href="#footnote377b"
class="citation">[377b]</a> child I have no concern about: I am
sorry in a civil way, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Yes, yes, Sir
George St. George dead. <a name="citation377c"></a><a
href="#footnote377c" class="citation">[377c]</a>&mdash;Go, cry,
Madam Dingley; I have written to the Dean.&nbsp; Raymond will be
rich, for he has the building itch.&nbsp; I wish all he has got
may put him out of debt.&nbsp; Poh, I have fires like lightning;
they cost me twelvepence a week, beside small coal.&nbsp; I have
got four new caps, madam, very fine and convenient, with striped
cambric, instead of muslin; so Patrick need not mend them, but
take the old ones.&nbsp; Stella snatched Dingley&rsquo;s word out
of her pen; Presto a cold?&nbsp; Why, all the world here is dead
with them: I never had anything like it in my life; &rsquo;tis
not gone in five weeks.&nbsp; I hope Leigh is with you before
this, and has brought your box.&nbsp; How do you like the ivory
rasp?&nbsp; Stella is angry; but I&rsquo;ll have a finer thing
for her.&nbsp; Is <a name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
378</span>not the apron as good?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I shall
never be paid it; so all&rsquo;s well again.&mdash;What? the
quarrel with Sir John Walter? <a name="citation378a"></a><a
href="#footnote378a" class="citation">[378a]</a>&nbsp; Why, we
had not one word of quarrel; only he railed at me when I was
gone: and Lord Keeper and Treasurer teased me for a week.&nbsp;
It was nuts to them; a serious thing with a vengeance.&mdash;The
Whigs may sell their estates then, or hang themselves, as they
are disposed; for a peace there will be.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer
told me that Connolly <a name="citation378b"></a><a
href="#footnote378b" class="citation">[378b]</a> was going to
Hanover.&nbsp; Your Provost <a name="citation378c"></a><a
href="#footnote378c" class="citation">[378c]</a> is a
coxcomb.&nbsp; Stella is a good girl for not being angry when I
tell her of spelling; I see none wrong in this.&nbsp; God
Almighty be praised that your disorder lessens; it increases my
hopes mightily that they will go off.&nbsp; And have you been
plagued with the fear of the plague? never mind those reports; I
have heard them five hundred times.&nbsp; Replevi?&nbsp;
Replevin, simpleton, &rsquo;tis Dingley I mean; but it is a hard
word, and so I&rsquo;ll excuse it.&nbsp; I stated Dingley&rsquo;s
accounts in my last. I forgot Catherine&rsquo;s sevenpenny
dinner.&nbsp; I hope it was the beef-steaks; I&rsquo;ll call and
eat them in spring; but Goody Stoyte must give me coffee, or
green tea, for I drink no bohea.&nbsp; Well, ay, the pamphlet;
but there are some additions to the fourth edition; the fifth
edition was of four thousand, in a smaller print, sold for
sixpence.&nbsp; Yes, I had the twenty-pound bill from Parvisol:
and what then?&nbsp; Pray now eat the Laracor apples; I beg you
not to keep them, but tell me what they are.&nbsp; You have had
Tooke&rsquo;s bill in my last.&nbsp; And so there now, your whole
letter is answered.&nbsp; I tell you what I do; I lay your letter
before me, and take it in order, and answer what is necessary;
and so and so.&nbsp; Well, when I expected we were all undone, I
designed to retire for six months, and then steal over to
Laracor; and I had in my mouth a thousand times two lines of
Shakespeare, where Cardinal Wolsey says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A weak old man, battered with storms of
state,<br />
Is come to lay his weary bones among you.&rdquo; <a
name="citation378d"></a><a href="#footnote378d"
class="citation">[378d]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I beg your pardon; I have cheated you all this margin, I did
<a name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 379</span>not
perceive it; and I went on wider and wider like Stella; awkward
sluts; <i>she writes so so</i>, <i>there</i>: <a
name="citation379"></a><a href="#footnote379"
class="citation">[379]</a> that&rsquo;s as like as two eggs a
penny.&mdash;&ldquo;A weak old man,&rdquo; now I am saying it,
and shall till to-morrow.&mdash;The Duke of Marlborough says
there is nothing he now desires so much as to contrive some way
how to soften Dr. Swift.&nbsp; He is mistaken; for those things
that have been hardest against him were not written by me.&nbsp;
Mr. Secretary told me this from a friend of the Duke&rsquo;s; and
I&rsquo;m sure now he is down, I shall not trample on him;
although I love him not, I dislike his being out.&mdash;Bernage
was to see me this morning, and gave some very indifferent
excuses for not calling here so long.&nbsp; I care not
twopence.&nbsp; Prince Eugene did not dine with the Duke of
Marlborough on Sunday, but was last night at Lady Betty
Germaine&rsquo;s assemblee, and a vast number of ladies to see
him.&nbsp; Mr. Lewis and I dined with a private friend.&nbsp; I
was this morning to see the Duke of Ormond, who appointed me to
meet him at the Cockpit at one, but never came.&nbsp; I sat too
some time with the Duchess.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t like things very
well yet.&nbsp; I am come home early, and going to be busy.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll go write.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; I could not go sleep last night till past two, and
was waked before three by a noise of people endeavouring to break
open my window.&nbsp; For a while I would not stir, thinking it
might be my imagination; but hearing the noise continued, I rose
and went to the window, and then it ceased.&nbsp; I went to bed
again, and heard it repeated more violently; then I rose and
called up the house, and got a candle: the rogues had lifted up
the sash a yard; there are great sheds before my windows,
although my lodgings be a storey high; and if they get upon the
sheds they are almost even with my window.&nbsp; We observed
their track, and panes of glass fresh broken.&nbsp; The watchmen
told us to-day they saw them, but could not catch them.&nbsp;
They attacked others in the neighbourhood about the same time,
and actually robbed a house in Suffolk Street, which is the next
street but one to us.&nbsp; It is <a name="page380"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 380</span>said they are seamen discharged from
service.&nbsp; I went up to call my man, and found his bed empty;
it seems he often lies abroad.&nbsp; I challenged him this
morning as one of the robbers.&nbsp; He is a sad dog; and the
minute I come to Ireland I will discard him.&nbsp; I have this
day got double iron bars to every window in my dining-room and
bed-chamber; and I hide my purse in my thread stocking between
the bed&rsquo;s head and the wainscot.&nbsp; Lewis and I dined
with an old Scotch friend, who brought the Duke of Douglas <a
name="citation380a"></a><a href="#footnote380a"
class="citation">[380a]</a> and three or four more Scots upon
us.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; This was our Society day, you know; but the Duke of
Ormond could not be with us, because he dined with Prince
Eugene.&nbsp; It cost me a guinea contribution to a poet, who had
made a copy of verses upon monkeys, applying the story to the
Duke of Marlborough; the rest gave two guineas, except the two
physicians, <a name="citation380b"></a><a href="#footnote380b"
class="citation">[380b]</a> who followed my example.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t like this custom: the next time I will give
nothing.&nbsp; I sat this evening at Lord Masham&rsquo;s with
Lord Treasurer: I don&rsquo;t like his countenance; nor I
don&rsquo;t like the posture of things well.</p>
<p class="poetry">We cannot be stout,<br />
Till Somerset&rsquo;s out:</p>
<p>as the old saying is.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Mr. Lewis and I dined with the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, who eats the most elegantly of any man I know in
town.&nbsp; I walked lustily in the Park by moonshine till eight,
to shake off my dinner and wine; and then went to sup at Mr.
Domville&rsquo;s with Ford, and stayed till twelve.&nbsp; It is
told me to-day as a great secret that the Duke of Somerset will
be out soon, that the thing is fixed; but what shall we do with
the Duchess?&nbsp; They say the Duke will make her leave the
Queen out of spite, if he be out.&nbsp; It has stuck upon that
fear a good while already.&nbsp; Well, but Lewis gave me a letter
from MD, N. 25.&nbsp; O Lord, I did not expect one this
fortnight, faith.&nbsp; You are mighty good, that&rsquo;s
certain: but I won&rsquo;t <a name="page381"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 381</span>answer it, because this goes
to-morrow, only what you say of the printer being taken up; I
value it not; all&rsquo;s safe there; nor do I fear anything,
unless the Ministry be changed: I hope that danger is over.&nbsp;
However, I shall be in Ireland before such a change; which could
not be, I think, till the end of the session, if the Whigs&rsquo;
designs had gone on.&mdash;Have not you an apron by Leigh, Madam
Stella? have you all I mentioned in a former letter?</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; This goes to-day as usual.&nbsp; I
think of going into the City; but of that at night.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis fine moderate weather these two or three days last.
Farewell, etc. etc.</p>
<h3>LETTER XXXIX.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Jan.</i> 12, 1711&ndash;12.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I sealed up my letter this
morning, I looked upon myself to be not worth a groat in the
world.&nbsp; Last night, after Mr. Ford and I left Domville, Ford
desired me to go with him for a minute upon earnest business, and
then told me that both he and I were ruined; for he had trusted
Stratford with five hundred pounds for tickets for the lottery,
and he had been with Stratford, who confessed he had lost fifteen
thousand pounds by Sir Stephen Evans, <a
name="citation381"></a><a href="#footnote381"
class="citation">[381]</a> who broke last week; that he concluded
Stratford must break too; that he could not get his tickets, but
Stratford made him several excuses, which seemed very blind ones,
etc.&nbsp; And Stratford had near four hundred pounds of mine, to
buy me five hundred pounds in the South Sea Company.&nbsp; I came
home reflecting a little; nothing concerned me but MD.&nbsp; I
called all my philosophy and religion up; and, I thank God, it
did not keep me awake beyond my usual time above a quarter of an
hour.&nbsp; This morning I sent for Tooke, whom I had employed to
buy the stock of Stratford, and settle things with him.&nbsp; He
told me I was secure; for Stratford had transferred it to me in
form in the South Sea House, and he <a name="page382"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 382</span>had accepted it for me, and all was
done on stamped parchment.&nbsp; However, he would be further
informed; and at night sent me a note to confirm me.&nbsp;
However, I am not yet secure; and, besides, am in pain for Ford,
whom I first brought acquainted with Stratford.&nbsp; I dined in
the City.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; Domville and I dined with Ford to-day by
appointment: the Lord Mansel told me at Court to-day that I was
engaged to him; but Stratford had promised Ford to meet him and
me to-night at Ford&rsquo;s lodgings.&nbsp; He did so; said he
had hopes to save himself in his affair with Evans.&nbsp; Ford
asked him for his tickets: he said he would send them to-morrow;
but looking in his pocket-book, said he believed he had some of
them about him, and gave him as many as came to two hundred
pounds, which rejoiced us much; besides, he talked so frankly,
that we might think there is no danger.&nbsp; I asked him, Was
there any more to be settled between us in my affair?&nbsp; He
said, No; and answered my questions just as Tooke had got them
from others; so I hope I am safe.&nbsp; This has been a scurvy
affair.&nbsp; I believe Stella would have half laughed at me, to
see a suspicious fellow like me overreached.&nbsp; I saw Prince
Eugene to-day at Court: I don&rsquo;t think him an ugly-faced
fellow, but well enough, and a good shape.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; The Parliament was to sit to-day, and met; but were
adjourned by the Queen&rsquo;s directions till Thursday.&nbsp;
She designs to make some important speech then.&nbsp; She
pretended illness; but I believe they were not ready, and they
expect some opposition: and the Scotch lords are angry, <a
name="citation382"></a><a href="#footnote382"
class="citation">[382]</a> and must be pacified.&nbsp; I was this
morning to invite the Duke of Ormond to our Society on Thursday,
where he is then to be introduced.&nbsp; He has appointed me at
twelve to-morrow about some business: I would fain have his help
to impeach a certain lord; but I doubt we shall make nothing of
it.&nbsp; I intended <a name="page383"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 383</span>to have dined with Lord Treasurer,
but I was told he would be busy: so I dined with Mrs. Van; and at
night I sat with Lord Masham till one.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer was
there, and chid me for not dining with him: he was in very good
humour.&nbsp; I brought home two flasks of burgundy in my chair:
I wish MD had them.&nbsp; You see it is very late; so I&rsquo;ll
go to bed, and bid MD good night.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; This morning I presented my printer and bookseller
to Lord Rivers, to be stationers to the Ordnance; stationers,
that&rsquo;s the word; I did not write it plain at first. I
believe it will be worth three hundred pounds a year between
them.&nbsp; This is the third employment I have got for
them.&nbsp; Rivers told them the Doctor commanded him, and he
durst not refuse it.&nbsp; I would have dined with Lord Treasurer
to-day again, but Lord Mansel would not let me, and forced me
home with him.&nbsp; I was very deep with the Duke of Ormond
to-day at the Cockpit, where we met to be private; but I doubt I
cannot do the mischief I intended.&nbsp; My friend Penn came
there, Will Penn the Quaker, at the head of his brethren, to
thank the Duke for his kindness to their people in Ireland.&nbsp;
To see a dozen scoundrels with their hats on, and the Duke
complimenting with his off, was a good sight enough.&nbsp; I sat
this evening with Sir William Robinson, <a
name="citation383"></a><a href="#footnote383"
class="citation">[383]</a> who has mighty often invited me to a
bottle of wine: and it is past twelve.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; This being fast-day, Dr. Freind and I went into the
City to dine late, like good fasters.&nbsp; My printer and
bookseller want me to hook in another employment for them in the
Tower, because it was enjoyed before by a stationer, although it
be to serve the Ordnance with oil, tallow, etc., and is worth
four hundred pounds per annum more: I will try what I can
do.&nbsp; They are resolved to ask several other employments of
the same nature to other offices; and I will then grease fat
sows, and see whether it be possible to satisfy them.&nbsp; Why
am not I a stationer?&nbsp; The Parliament sits to-morrow, <a
name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 384</span>and
Walpole, late Secretary at War, is to be swinged for bribery, and
the Queen is to communicate something of great importance to the
two Houses, at least they say so.&nbsp; But I must think of
answering your letter in a day or two.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; I went this morning to the Duke of Ormond about some
business, and he told me he could not dine with us to-day, being
to dine with Prince Eugene.&nbsp; Those of our Society of the
House of Commons could not be with us, the House sitting late on
Walpole.&nbsp; I left them at nine, and they were not come.&nbsp;
We kept some dinner for them.&nbsp; I hope Walpole will be sent
to the Tower, and expelled the House; but this afternoon the
members I spoke with in the Court of Requests talked dubiously of
it.&nbsp; It will be a leading card to maul the Duke of
Marlborough for the same crime, or at least to censure him.&nbsp;
The Queen&rsquo;s message was only to give them notice of the
peace she is treating, and to desire they will make some law to
prevent libels against the Government; so farewell to Grub
Street.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; I heard to-day that the commoners of our Society did
not leave the Parliament till eleven at night, then went to those
I left, and stayed till three in the morning.&nbsp; Walpole is
expelled, and sent to the Tower.&nbsp; I was this morning again
with Lord Rivers, and have made him give the other employment to
my printer and bookseller; &rsquo;tis worth a great deal.&nbsp; I
dined with my friend Lewis privately, to talk over affairs.&nbsp;
We want to have this Duke of Somerset out, and he apprehends it
will not be, but I hope better.&nbsp; They are going now at last
to change the Commissioners of the Customs; my friend Sir Matthew
Dudley will be out, and three more, and Prior will be in.&nbsp; I
have made Ford copy out a small pamphlet, and sent it to the
press, that I might not be known for author; &rsquo;tis <i>A
Letter to the October Club</i>, <a name="citation384"></a><a
href="#footnote384" class="citation">[384]</a> if ever you heard
of such a thing.&mdash;Methinks this letter goes on but slowly
for almost a week: I want some little conversation with MD, and
to know what they are doing just now.&nbsp; I am <a
name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 385</span>sick of
politics.&nbsp; I have not dined with Lord Treasurer these three
weeks: he chides me, but I don&rsquo;t care: I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord Treasurer: this is his day
of choice company, where they sometimes admit me, but pretend to
grumble.&nbsp; And to-day they met on some extraordinary
business; the Keeper, Steward, both Secretaries, Lord Rivers, and
Lord Anglesea: I left them at seven, and came away, and have been
writing to the Bishop of Clogher.&nbsp; I forgot to know where to
direct to him since Sir George St. George&rsquo;s death, <a
name="citation385a"></a><a href="#footnote385a"
class="citation">[385a]</a> but I have directed to the same
house: you must tell me better, for the letter is sent by the
bellman.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t write to me again till this is gone, I
charge you, for I won&rsquo;t answer two letters together.&nbsp;
The Duke of Somerset is out, and was with his yellow liveries at
Parliament to-day.&nbsp; You know he had the same with the Queen,
when he was Master of the Horse: we hope the Duchess will follow,
or that he will take her away in spite.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer, I
hope, has now saved his head.&nbsp; Has the Dean received my
letter? ask him at cards to-night.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; There was a world of people to-day at Court to see
Prince Eugene, but all bit, for he did not come.&nbsp; I saw the
Duchess of Somerset talking with the Duke of Buckingham; she
looked a little down, but was extremely courteous.&nbsp; The
Queen has the gout, but is not in much pain.&nbsp; Must I fill
this line too? <a name="citation385b"></a><a href="#footnote385b"
class="citation">[385b]</a> well then, so let it be.&nbsp; The
Duke of Beaufort <a name="citation385c"></a><a
href="#footnote385c" class="citation">[385c]</a> has a mighty
mind to come into our Society; shall we let him?&nbsp; I spoke to
the Duke of Ormond about it, and he doubts a little whether to
let him in or no.&nbsp; They say the Duke of Somerset is advised
by his friends to let his wife stay with the Queen; I am sorry
for it.&nbsp; I dined with the Secretary <a
name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 386</span>to-day,
with mixed company; I don&rsquo;t love it.&nbsp; Our Society does
not meet till Friday, because Thursday will be a busy day in the
House of Commons, for then the Duke of Marlborough&rsquo;s
bribery is to be examined into about the pension paid him by
those that furnished bread to the army.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; I have been five times with the Duke of Ormond about
a perfect trifle, and he forgets it: I used him like a dog this
morning for it.&nbsp; I was asked to-day by several in the Court
of Requests whether it was true that the author of the
<i>Examiner</i> was taken up in an action of twenty thousand
pounds by the Duke of Marlborough? <a name="citation386a"></a><a
href="#footnote386a" class="citation">[386a]</a>&nbsp; I dined in
the City, where my printer showed me a pamphlet, called <i>Advice
to the October Club</i>, which he said was sent him by an unknown
hand: I commended it mightily; he never suspected me; &rsquo;tis
a twopenny pamphlet.&nbsp; I came home and got timely to bed; but
about eleven one of the Secretary&rsquo;s servants came to me to
let me know that Lord Treasurer would immediately speak to me at
Lord Masham&rsquo;s upon earnest business, and that, if I was
abed, I should rise and come.&nbsp; I did so: Lord Treasurer was
above with the Queen; and when he came down he laughed, and said
it was not he that sent for me: the business was of no great
importance, only to give me a paper, which might have been done
to-morrow.&nbsp; I stayed with them till past one, and then got
to bed again.&nbsp; Pize <a name="citation386b"></a><a
href="#footnote386b" class="citation">[386b]</a> take their
frolics.&nbsp; I thought to have answered your letter.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; Dr. Gastrell was to see me this morning: he is an
eminent divine, one of the canons of Christ Church, and one I
love very well: he said he was glad to find I was not with James
Broad.&nbsp; I asked what he meant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;have you not seen the Grub Street paper, that says Dr.
Swift was taken up as author of the <i>Examiner</i>, on an action
of twenty thousand pounds, and was now at James
Broad&rsquo;s?&rdquo; who, I suppose, is some bailiff.&nbsp; I
knew of this; but at the <a name="page387"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 387</span>Court of Requests twenty people told
me they heard I had been taken up.&nbsp; Lord Lansdowne observed
to the Secretary and me that the Whigs spread three lies
yesterday; that about me; and another, that Maccartney, who was
turned out last summer, <a name="citation387a"></a><a
href="#footnote387a" class="citation">[387a]</a> is again
restored to his places in the army; and the third, that Jack
Hill&rsquo;s commission for Lieutenant of the Tower is stopped,
and that Cadogan is to continue.&nbsp; Lansdowne thinks they have
some design by these reports; I cannot guess it.&nbsp; Did I tell
you that Sacheverell has desired mightily to come and see me? but
I have put it off: he has heard that I have spoken to the
Secretary in behalf of a brother whom he maintains, and who
desires an employment. <a name="citation387b"></a><a
href="#footnote387b" class="citation">[387b]</a>&nbsp;
T&rsquo;other day at the Court of Requests Dr. Yalden <a
name="citation387c"></a><a href="#footnote387c"
class="citation">[387c]</a> saluted me by name: Sacheverell, who
was just by, came up to me, and made me many acknowledgment and
compliments.&nbsp; Last night I desired Lord Treasurer to do
something for that brother of Sacheverell&rsquo;s: he said he
never knew he had a brother, but thanked me for telling him, and
immediately put his name in his table-book. <a
name="citation387d"></a><a href="#footnote387d"
class="citation">[387d]</a>&nbsp; I will let Sacheverell know
this, that he may take his measures accordingly, but he shall be
none of my acquaintance.&nbsp; I dined to-day privately with the
Secretary, left him at six, paid a visit or two, and came
home.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; I dined again to-day with the Secretary, but could
not despatch some business I had with him, he has so much besides
upon his hands at this juncture, and preparing against the great
business to-morrow, which we are top full of.&nbsp; The
Minister&rsquo;s design is that the Duke of Marlborough shall be
censured as gently as possible, provided his friends will not
make head to defend him, but if they do, it may end in some <a
name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 388</span>severer
votes.&nbsp; A gentleman, who was just now with him, tells me he
is much cast down, and fallen away; but he is positive, if he has
but ten friends in the House, that they shall defend him to the
utmost, and endeavour to prevent the least censure upon him,
which I think cannot be, since the bribery is manifest.&nbsp; Sir
Solomon Medina <a name="citation388a"></a><a href="#footnote388a"
class="citation">[388a]</a> paid him six thousand pounds a year
to have the employment of providing bread for the army, and the
Duke owns it in his letter to the Commissioners of
Accounts.&nbsp; I was to-night at Lord Masham&rsquo;s: Lord
Dupplin took out my new little pamphlet, and the Secretary read a
great deal of it to Lord Treasurer: they all commended it to the
skies, and so did I, and they began a health to the author.&nbsp;
But I doubt Lord Treasurer suspected; for he said, &ldquo;This is
Mr. Davenant&rsquo;s style,&rdquo; which is his cant when he
suspects me. <a name="citation388b"></a><a href="#footnote388b"
class="citation">[388b]</a>&nbsp; But I carried the matter very
well.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer put the pamphlet in his pocket to read
at home.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll answer your letter to-morrow.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; The Secretary made me promise to dine with him
to-day, after the Parliament was up: I said I would come; but I
dined at my usual time, knowing the House would sit late on this
great affair.&nbsp; I dined at a tavern with Mr. Domville and
another gentleman; I have not done so before these many
months.&nbsp; At ten this evening I went to the Secretary, but he
was not come home: I sat with his lady till twelve, then came
away; and he just came as I was gone, and he sent to my lodgings,
but I would not go back; and so I know not how things have
passed, but hope all is well; and I will tell you to-morrow
day.&nbsp; It is late, etc.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; The Secretary sent to me this morning to know
whether we should dine together.&nbsp; I went to him, and there I
learned that the question went against the Duke of Marlborough,
by a majority of a hundred; so the Ministry is mighty well
satisfied, and the Duke will now be able to do <a
name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 389</span>no
hurt.&nbsp; The Secretary and I, and Lord Masham, etc., dined
with Lieutenant-General Withers, <a name="citation389a"></a><a
href="#footnote389a" class="citation">[389a]</a> who is just
going to look after the army in Flanders: the Secretary and I
left them a little after seven, and I am come home, and will now
answer your letter, because this goes to-morrow: let me
see&mdash;The box at Chester; oh, burn that box, and hang that
Sterne; I have desired one to inquire for it who went toward
Ireland last Monday, but I am in utter despair of it.&nbsp; No, I
was not splenetic; you see what plunges the Court has been at to
set all right again.&nbsp; And that Duchess is not out yet, and
may one day cause more mischief.&nbsp; Somerset shows all about a
letter from the Queen, desiring him to let his wife continue with
her.&nbsp; Is not that rare!&nbsp; I find Dingley smelled a rat;
because the Whigs are <i>upish</i>; but if ever I hear that word
again, I&rsquo;ll <i>uppish</i> you.&nbsp; I am glad you got your
rasp safe and sound; does Stella like her apron?&nbsp; Your
critics about guarantees of succession are puppies; that&rsquo;s
an answer to the objection.&nbsp; The answerers here made the
same objection, but it is wholly wrong.&nbsp; I am of your
opinion that Lord Marlborough is used too hardly: I have often
scratched out passages from papers and pamphlets sent me, before
they were printed, because I thought them too severe.&nbsp; But
he is certainly a vile man, and has no sort of merit beside the
military.&nbsp; The <i>Examiners</i> are good for little: I would
fain have hindered the severity of the two or three last, but
could not.&nbsp; I will either bring your papers over, or leave
them with Tooke, for whose honesty I will engage.&nbsp; And I
think it is best not to venture them with me at sea.&nbsp; Stella
is a prophet, by foretelling so very positively that all would be
well.&nbsp; Duke of Ormond speak against peace?&nbsp; No,
simpleton, he is one of the staunchest we have for the
Ministry.&nbsp; Neither trouble yourself about the printer: he
appeared the first day of the term, and is to appear when
summoned again; but nothing else will come of it.&nbsp; Lord
Chief-Justice <a name="citation389b"></a><a href="#footnote389b"
class="citation">[389b]</a> is <a name="page390"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 390</span>cooled since this new
settlement.&nbsp; No; I will not split my journals in half; I
will write but once a fortnight: but you may do as you will;
which is, read only half at once, and t&rsquo;other half next
week.&nbsp; So now your letter is answered.&nbsp; (P&mdash; on
these blots.)&nbsp; What must I say more?&nbsp; I will set out in
March, if there be a fit of fine weather; unless the Ministry
desire me to stay till the end of the session, which may be a
month longer; but I believe they will not: for I suppose the
peace will be made, and they will have no further service for
me.&nbsp; I must make my canal fine this summer, as fine as I
can.&nbsp; I am afraid I shall see great neglects among my
quicksets.&nbsp; I hope the cherry-trees on the river walk are
fine things now.&nbsp; But no more of this.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; I forgot to finish this letter this morning, and am
come home so late I must give it to the bellman; but I would have
it go to-night, lest you should think there is anything in the
story of my being arrested in an action of twenty thousand pounds
by Lord Marlborough, which I hear is in Dyer&rsquo;s Letter, <a
name="citation390"></a><a href="#footnote390"
class="citation">[390]</a> and, consequently, I suppose, gone to
Ireland.&nbsp; Farewell, dearest MD, etc. etc.</p>
<h3>LETTER XL.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Jan.</i> 26, 1711&ndash;12.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> no gilt paper left of this
size, so you must be content with plain.&nbsp; Our Society dined
together to-day, for it was put off, as I told you, upon Lord
Marlborough&rsquo;s business on Thursday.&nbsp; The Duke of
Ormond dined with us to-day, the first time: we were thirteen at
table; and Lord Lansdowne came in after dinner, so that we wanted
but three.&nbsp; The Secretary proposed the Duke of Beaufort, who
<a name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 391</span>desires
to be one of our Society; but I stopped it, because the Duke of
Ormond doubts a little about it; and he was gone before it was
proposed.&nbsp; I left them at seven, and sat this evening with
poor Mrs. Wesley, who has been mightily ill to-day with a
fainting fit; she has often convulsions, too: she takes a mixture
with asafoetida, which I have now in my nose, and everything
smells of it.&nbsp; I never smelt it before; &rsquo;tis
abominable.&nbsp; We have eight packets, they say, due from
Ireland.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; I could not see Prince Eugene at Court to-day, the
crowd was so great.&nbsp; The Whigs contrive to have a crowd
always about him, and employ the rabble to give the word, when he
sets out from any place.&nbsp; When the Duchess of Hamilton came
from the Queen after church, she whispered me that she was going
to pay me a visit.&nbsp; I went to Lady Oglethorpe&rsquo;s, the
place appointed; for ladies always visit me in third places; and
she kept me till near four: she talks too much, is a plaguy
detractor, and I believe I shall not much like her.&nbsp; I was
engaged to dine with Lord Masham: they stayed as long as they
could, yet had almost dined, and were going in anger to pull down
the brass peg for my hat, but Lady Masham saved it.&nbsp; At
eight I went again to Lord Masham&rsquo;s; Lord Treasurer is
generally there at night: we sat up till almost two.&nbsp; Lord
Treasurer has engaged me to contrive some way to keep the
Archbishop of York <a name="citation391"></a><a
href="#footnote391" class="citation">[391]</a> from being seduced
by Lord Nottingham.&nbsp; I will do what I can in it
to-morrow.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very late, so I must go sleep.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; Poor Mrs. Manley, the author, is very ill of a
dropsy and sore leg: the printer tells me he is afraid she cannot
live long.&nbsp; I am heartily sorry for her: she has very
generous principles for one of her sort, and a great deal of good
sense and invention: she is about forty, very homely, and very
fat.&nbsp; Mrs. Van made me dine with her to-day.&nbsp; I was
this <a name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
392</span>morning with the Duke of Ormond and the Prolocutor
about what Lord Treasurer spoke to me yesterday; I know not what
will be the issue.&nbsp; There is but a slender majority in the
House of Lords, and we want more.&nbsp; We are sadly mortified at
the news of the French taking the town in Brazil from the
Portuguese.&nbsp; The sixth edition of three thousand of the
<i>Conduct of the Allies</i> is sold, and the printer talks of a
seventh: eleven thousand of them have been sold, which is a most
prodigious run.&nbsp; The little twopenny <i>Letter of Advice to
the October Club</i> does not sell: I know not the reason, for it
is finely written, I assure you; and, like a true author, I grow
fond of it, because it does not sell: you know that it is usual
to writers to condemn the judgment of the world: if I had hinted
it to be mine, everybody would have bought it, but it is a great
secret.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; I borrowed one or two idle books of <i>Contes des
F&eacute;es</i>, <a name="citation392a"></a><a
href="#footnote392a" class="citation">[392a]</a> and have been
reading them these two days, although I have much business upon
my hands.&nbsp; I loitered till one at home; then went to Mr.
Lewis at his office; and the Vice-Chamberlain told me that Lady
Rialton <a name="citation392b"></a><a href="#footnote392b"
class="citation">[392b]</a> had yesterday resigned her employment
of lady of the bed-chamber, and that Lady Jane Hyde, <a
name="citation392c"></a><a href="#footnote392c"
class="citation">[392c]</a> Lord Rochester&rsquo;s daughter, a
mighty pretty girl, is to succeed.&nbsp; He said, too, that Lady
Sunderland would resign in a day or two.&nbsp; I dined with
Lewis, and then went to see Mrs. Wesley, who is better
to-day.&nbsp; But you must know that Mr. Lewis gave me two
letters, one from the Bishop of Cloyne, with an enclosed from
Lord Inchiquin <a name="citation392d"></a><a href="#footnote392d"
class="citation">[392d]</a> to Lord Treasurer, which he desires I
would deliver and recommend.&nbsp; I am told that lord was much
in with Lord Wharton, and I remember he was to have been one of
the Lords Justices by <a name="page393"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 393</span>his recommendation; yet the Bishop
recommends him as a great friend to the Church, etc.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll do what I think proper.&nbsp; T&rsquo;other letter was
from little saucy MD, N. 26.&nbsp; O Lord, never saw the like,
under a cover, too, and by way of journal; we shall never have
done.&nbsp; Sirrahs, how durst you write so soon, sirrahs?&nbsp;
I won&rsquo;t answer it yet.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; I was this morning with the Secretary, who was sick,
and out of humour: he would needs drink champagne some days ago,
on purpose to spite me, because I advised him against it, and now
he pays for it.&nbsp; Stella used to do such tricks formerly; he
put me in mind of her.&nbsp; Lady Sunderland has resigned her
place too.&nbsp; It is Lady Catherine Hyde <a
name="citation393a"></a><a href="#footnote393a"
class="citation">[393a]</a> that succeeds Lady Rialton, and not
Lady Jane.&nbsp; Lady Catherine is the late Earl of
Rochester&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; I dined with the Secretary,
then visited his lady; and sat this evening with Lady Masham: the
Secretary came to us; but Lord Treasurer did not; he dined with
the Master of the Rolls, <a name="citation393b"></a><a
href="#footnote393b" class="citation">[393b]</a> and stayed late
with him.&nbsp; Our Society does not meet till to-morrow
se&rsquo;nnight, because we think the Parliament will be very
busy to-morrow upon the state of the war, and the Secretary, who
is to treat as President, must be in the House.&nbsp; I fancy my
talking of persons and things here must be very tedious to you,
because you know nothing of them, and I talk as if you did.&nbsp;
You know Kevin&rsquo;s Street, and Werburgh Street, and (what do
you call the street where Mrs. Walls lives?) and Ingoldsby, <a
name="citation393c"></a><a href="#footnote393c"
class="citation">[393c]</a> and Higgins, <a
name="citation393d"></a><a href="#footnote393d"
class="citation">[393d]</a> and Lord Santry; <a
name="citation393e"></a><a href="#footnote393e"
class="citation">[393e]</a> but what care you for Lady Catherine
Hyde?&nbsp; Why do you say nothing of your health, sirrah?&nbsp;
I hope it is well.</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; Trimnel, Bishop of Norwich, <a
name="citation393f"></a><a href="#footnote393f"
class="citation">[393f]</a> who was with this Lord <a
name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 394</span>Sunderland
at Moor Park in their travels, preached yesterday before the
House of Lords; and to-day the question was put to thank him, and
print his sermon; but passed against him; for it was a terrible
Whig sermon.&nbsp; The Bill to repeal the Act for naturalising
Protestant foreigners passed the House of Lords to-day by a
majority of twenty, though the Scotch lords went out, and would
vote neither way, in discontent about the Duke of
Hamilton&rsquo;s patent, if you know anything of it.&nbsp; A poem
is come out to-day inscribed to me, by way of a flirt; <a
name="citation394a"></a><a href="#footnote394a"
class="citation">[394a]</a> for it is a Whiggish poem, and good
for nothing.&nbsp; They plagued me with it in the Court of
Requests.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Treasurer at five alone, only
with one Dutchman.&nbsp; Prior is now a Commissioner of the
Customs.&nbsp; I told you so before, I suppose.&nbsp; When I came
home to-night, I found a letter from Dr. Sacheverell, thanking me
for recommending his brother to Lord Treasurer and Mr. Secretary
for a place.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer sent to him about it: so good a
solicitor was I, although I once hardly thought I should be a
solicitor for Sacheverell.</p>
<p>Feb. 1.&nbsp; Has not your Dean of St. Patrick received my
letter? you say nothing of it, although I writ above a month
ago.&nbsp; My printer has got the gout, and I was forced to go to
him to-day, and there I dined.&nbsp; It was a most delicious day:
why don&rsquo;t you observe whether the same days be fine with
you?&nbsp; To-night, at six, Dr. Atterbury, and Prior, and I, and
Dr. Freind, met at Dr. Robert Freind&rsquo;s <a
name="citation394b"></a><a href="#footnote394b"
class="citation">[394b]</a> house at Westminster, who is master
of the school: there we sat till one, and were good enough
company.&nbsp; I here take leave to tell politic Dingley that the
passage in the <i>Conduct of the Allies</i> is so far from being
blamable that the Secretary designs to insist upon it in the
House of Commons, when the Treaty of Barrier <a
name="citation394c"></a><a href="#footnote394c"
class="citation">[394c]</a> is debated there, as it now shortly
will, for they have ordered it to be laid before them.&nbsp; The
pamphlet of Advice to the October Club begins now to sell; but I
believe its fame will hardly reach Ireland: &rsquo;tis finely
written, I assure you.&nbsp; I long to answer your letter, but
won&rsquo;t yet; you know, &rsquo;tis late, etc.</p>
<p><a name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
395</span>2.&nbsp; This ends Christmas, <a
name="citation395a"></a><a href="#footnote395a"
class="citation">[395a]</a> and what care I?&nbsp; I have neither
seen, nor felt, nor heard any Christmas this year.&nbsp; I passed
a lazy dull day.&nbsp; I was this morning with Lord Treasurer, to
get some papers from him, which he will remember as much as a
cat, although it be his own business.&nbsp; It threatened rain,
but did not much; and Prior and I walked an hour in the Park,
which quite put me out of my measures.&nbsp; I dined with a
friend hard by; and in the evening sat with Lord Masham till
twelve.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer did not come; this is an idle
dining-day usually with him.&nbsp; We want to hear from Holland
how our peace goes on; for we are afraid of those scoundrels the
Dutch, lest they should play us tricks.&nbsp; Lord Mar, <a
name="citation395b"></a><a href="#footnote395b"
class="citation">[395b]</a> a Scotch earl, was with us at Lord
Masham&rsquo;s: I was arguing with him about the stubbornness and
folly of his countrymen; they are so angry about the affair of
the Duke of Hamilton, whom the Queen has made a duke of England,
and the House of Lords will not admit him.&nbsp; He swears he
would vote for us, but dare not, because all Scotland would
detest him if he did: he should never be chosen again, nor be
able to live there.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I was at Court to-day to look for a dinner, but did
not like any that were offered me; and I dined with Lord
Mountjoy.&nbsp; The Queen has the gout in her knee, and was not
at chapel.&nbsp; I hear we have a Dutch mail, but I know not what
news, although I was with the Secretary this morning.&nbsp; He
showed me a letter from the Hanover Envoy, Mr. Bothmar,
complaining that the Barrier Treaty is laid before the House of
Commons; and desiring that no infringement may be made in the
guarantee of the succession; but the Secretary has written him a
peppering answer.&nbsp; I fancy you understand all this, and are
able states-girls, since you have read the <i>Conduct of the
Allies</i>.&nbsp; We are all preparing against the Birthday; I
think it is Wednesday next.&nbsp; If the Queen&rsquo;s gout
increases, it will spoil sport.&nbsp; Prince Eugene has two fine
suits made against it; and the Queen is to give him a sword worth
four thousand pounds, the diamonds set transparent.</p>
<p><a name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
396</span>4.&nbsp; I was this morning soliciting at the House of
Commons&rsquo; door for Mr. Vesey, a son of the Archbishop of
Tuam, <a name="citation396"></a><a href="#footnote396"
class="citation">[396]</a> who has petitioned for a Bill to
relieve him in some difficulty about his estate: I secured him
above fifty members.&nbsp; I dined with Lady Masham.&nbsp; We
have no packet from Holland, as I was told yesterday: and this
wind will hinder many people from appearing at the Birthday, who
expected clothes from Holland.&nbsp; I appointed to meet a
gentleman at the Secretary&rsquo;s to-night, and they both
failed.&nbsp; The House of Commons have this day made many severe
votes about our being abused by our Allies.&nbsp; Those who spoke
drew all their arguments from my book, and their votes confirm
all I writ; the Court had a majority of a hundred and fifty: all
agree that it was my book that spirited them to these
resolutions; I long to see them in print.&nbsp; My head has not
been as well as I could wish it for some days past, but I have
not had any giddy fit, and I hope it will go over.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The Secretary turned me out of his room this morning,
and showed me fifty guineas rolled up, which he was going to give
some French spy.&nbsp; I dined with four Irishmen at a tavern
to-day: I thought I had resolved against it before, but I broke
it.&nbsp; I played at cards this evening at Lady Masham&rsquo;s,
but I only played for her while she was waiting; and I won her a
pool, and supped there.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer was with us, but
went away before twelve.&nbsp; The ladies and lords have all
their clothes ready against to-morrow: I saw several mighty fine,
and I hope there will be a great appearance, in spite of that
spiteful French fashion of the Whiggish ladies not to come, which
they have all resolved to a woman; and I hope it will more spirit
the Queen against them for ever.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I went to dine at Lord Masham&rsquo;s at three, and
met all the company just coming out of Court; a mighty crowd:
they stayed long for their coaches: I had an opportunity of
seeing several lords and ladies of my acquaintance in their <a
name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
397</span>fineries.&nbsp; Lady Ashburnham <a
name="citation397a"></a><a href="#footnote397a"
class="citation">[397a]</a> looked the best in my eyes.&nbsp;
They say the Court was never fuller nor finer.&nbsp; Lord
Treasurer, his lady, and two daughters and Mrs. Hill, dined with
Lord and Lady Masham; the five ladies were monstrous fine.&nbsp;
The Queen gave Prince Eugene the diamond sword to-day; but nobody
was by when she gave it except my Lord Chamberlain.&nbsp; There
was an entertainment of opera songs at night, and the Queen was
at all the entertainment, and is very well after it.&nbsp; I saw
Lady Wharton, <a name="citation397b"></a><a href="#footnote397b"
class="citation">[397b]</a> as ugly as the devil, coming out in
the crowd all in an undress; she has been with the Marlborough
daughters <a name="citation397c"></a><a href="#footnote397c"
class="citation">[397c]</a> and Lady Bridgewater <a
name="citation397d"></a><a href="#footnote397d"
class="citation">[397d]</a> in St. James&rsquo;s, looking out of
the window all undressed to see the sight.&nbsp; I do not hear
that one Whig lady was there, except those of the
bed-chamber.&nbsp; Nothing has made so great a noise as one
Kelson&rsquo;s chariot, that cost nine hundred and thirty pounds,
the finest was ever seen.&nbsp; The rabble huzzaed him as much as
they did Prince Eugene.&nbsp; This is Birthday chat.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Our Society met to-day: the Duke of Ormond was not
with us; we have lessened our dinners, which were grown so
extravagant that Lord Treasurer and everybody else cried
shame.&nbsp; I left them at seven, visited for an hour, and then
came home, like a good boy.&nbsp; The Queen is much better after
yesterday&rsquo;s exercise: her friends wish she would use a
little more.&nbsp; I opposed Lord Jersey&rsquo;s <a
name="citation397e"></a><a href="#footnote397e"
class="citation">[397e]</a> election into our Society, and he is
refused: I likewise opposed the Duke of Beaufort; but I believe
he will be chosen in spite of me: I don&rsquo;t much care; I
shall not be with them above two months; for I resolve to set out
for Ireland the beginning of April next (before I treat them
again), and see my willows.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; I dined to-day in the City.&nbsp; This morning a
scoundrel <a name="page398"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
398</span>dog, one of the Queen&rsquo;s music, a German, whom I
had never seen, got access to me in my chamber by Patrick&rsquo;s
folly, and gravely desired me to get an employment in the Customs
for a friend of his, who would be very grateful; and likewise to
forward a project of his own, for raising ten thousand pounds a
year upon operas: I used him civiller than he deserved; but it
vexed me to the pluck. <a name="citation398a"></a><a
href="#footnote398a" class="citation">[398a]</a>&nbsp; He was
told I had a mighty interest with Lord Treasurer, and one word of
mine, etc.&nbsp; Well; I got home early on purpose to answer
MD&rsquo;s letter, N. 26; for this goes to-morrow.&mdash;Well; I
never saw such a letter in all my life; so saucy, so journalish,
so sanguine, so pretending, so everything.&nbsp; I satisfied all
your fears in my last: all is gone well, as you say; yet you are
an impudent slut to be so positive; you will swagger so upon your
sagacity that we shall never have done.&nbsp; Pray don&rsquo;t
mislay your reply; I would certainly print it, if I had it here:
how long is it? I suppose half a sheet: was the answer written in
Ireland?&nbsp; Yes, yes, you shall have a letter when you come
from Ballygall.&nbsp; I need not tell you again who&rsquo;s out
and who&rsquo;s in: we can never get out the Duchess of
Somerset.&mdash;So, they say Presto writ the <i>Conduct</i>,
etc.&nbsp; Do they like it?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care whether they
do or no; but the resolutions printed t&rsquo;other day in the
Votes are almost quotations from it, and would never have passed
if that book had not been written.&nbsp; I will not meddle with
the Spectator, let him fair-sex it to the world&rsquo;s
end.&nbsp; My disorder is over, but blood was not from the
p-les.&mdash;Well, Madam Dingley, the frost; why, we had a great
frost, but I forget how long ago; it lasted above a week or ten
days: I believe about six weeks ago; but it did not break so soon
with us, I think, as December 29; yet I think it was about that
time, on second thoughts.&nbsp; MD can have no letter from
Presto, says you; and yet four days before you own you had my
thirty-seventh, unreasonable sluts!&nbsp; The Bishop of
Gloucester is not dead, <a name="citation398b"></a><a
href="#footnote398b" class="citation">[398b]</a> and I am as
likely to succeed the Duke of Marlborough as him if he were;
there&rsquo;s <a name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
399</span>enough for that now.&nbsp; It is not unlikely that the
Duke of Shrewsbury will be your Governor; at least I believe the
Duke of Ormond will not return.&mdash;Well, Stella again: why,
really three editions of the <i>Conduct</i>, etc., is very much
for Ireland; it is a sign you have some honest among you.&nbsp;
Well; I will do Mr. Manley <a name="citation399a"></a><a
href="#footnote399a" class="citation">[399a]</a> all the service
I can; but he will ruin himself.&nbsp; What business had he to
engage at all about the City?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t he wish his cause
well, and be quiet, when he finds that stirring will do it no
good, and himself a great deal of hurt?&nbsp; I cannot imagine
who should open my letter: it must be done at your side.&mdash;If
I hear of any thoughts of turning out Mr. Manley, I will
endeavour to prevent it.&nbsp; I have already had all the
gentlemen of Ireland here upon my back often, for defending
him.&nbsp; So now I have answered your saucy letter.&nbsp; My
humble service to Goody Stoyte and Catherine; I will come soon
for my dinner.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; My cold goes off at last; but I think
I have got a small new one.&nbsp; I have no news since
last.&nbsp; They say we hear by the way of Calais, that peace is
very near concluding.&nbsp; I hope it may be true.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll go and seal up my letter, and give it myself to-night
into the post-office; and so I bid my dearest MD farewell till
to-night.&nbsp; I heartily wish myself with them, as hope
saved.&nbsp; My willows, and quicksets, and trees, will be finely
improved, I hope, this year.&nbsp; It has been fine hard frosty
weather yesterday and to-day.&nbsp; Farewell, etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Feb.</i> 9, 1711&ndash;12.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> my letter is gone, and I have
none of yours to answer, my conscience is so clear, and my
shoulder so light, and I go on with such courage to prate upon
nothing <a name="page400"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Sir Matthew Dudley, who is newly turned out of Commission of the
Customs.&nbsp; He affects a good heart, and talks in the
extremity of Whiggery, which was always his principle, though he
was gentle a little, while he kept in employment.&nbsp; We can
yet get no packets from Holland.&nbsp; I have not been with any
of the Ministry these two or three days.&nbsp; I keep out of
their way on purpose, for a certain reason, for some time, though
I must dine with the Secretary to-morrow, the choosing of the
company being left to me.&nbsp; I have engaged Lord Anglesea <a
name="citation400a"></a><a href="#footnote400a"
class="citation">[400a]</a> and Lord Carteret, <a
name="citation400b"></a><a href="#footnote400b"
class="citation">[400b]</a> and have promised to get three more;
but I have a mind that none else should be admitted: however, if
I like anybody at Court to-morrow, I may perhaps invite
them.&nbsp; I have got another cold, but not very bad.&nbsp; Nite
. . . MD.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; I saw Prince Eugene at Court to-day very plain;
he&rsquo;s plaguy yellow, and tolerably ugly besides.&nbsp; The
Court was very full, and people had their Birthday clothes.&nbsp;
I dined with the Secretary to-day.&nbsp; I was to invite five,
but I only invited two, Lord Anglesea and Lord Carteret.&nbsp;
Pshaw, I told you this but yesterday.&nbsp; We have no packets
from Holland yet.&nbsp; Here are a parcel of drunken Whiggish
lords, like your Lord Santry, <a name="citation400c"></a><a
href="#footnote400c" class="citation">[400c]</a> who come into
chocolate-houses and rail aloud at the Tories, and have
challenges sent them, and the next morning come and beg
pardon.&nbsp; General Ross <a name="citation400d"></a><a
href="#footnote400d" class="citation">[400d]</a> was like to
swinge the Marquis of Winchester <a name="citation400e"></a><a
href="#footnote400e" class="citation">[400e]</a> for this trick
t&rsquo;other day; and we have nothing else now to talk of till
the Parliament has had another bout with the state of the war, as
they intended in a few days.&nbsp; They have ordered the Barrier
Treaty to be laid before them; and it was talked some time ago,
as if there was a design to impeach Lord <a
name="page401"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 401</span>Townshend,
who made it.&nbsp; I have no more politics now.&nbsp; Nite dee
MD.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Anglesea to-day, who had seven
Irishmen to be my companions, of which two only were coxcombs;
one I did not know, and t&rsquo;other was young Blith, <a
name="citation401a"></a><a href="#footnote401a"
class="citation">[401a]</a> who is a puppy of figure here, with a
fine chariot.&nbsp; He asked me one day at Court, when I had been
just talking with some lords who stood near me, &ldquo;Doctor,
when shall we see you in the county of Meath?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
whispered him to take care what he said, for the people would
think he was some barbarian.&nbsp; He never would speak to me
since, till we met to-day.&nbsp; I went to Lady Masham&rsquo;s
to-night, and sat with Lord Treasurer and the Secretary there
till past two o&rsquo;clock; and when I came home, found some
letters from Ireland, which I read, but can say nothing of them
till to-morrow, &rsquo;tis so very late; but I <a
name="citation401b"></a><a href="#footnote401b"
class="citation">[401b]</a> must always be . . ., <a

<p>12.&nbsp; One letter was from the Bishop of Clogher last
night, and t&rsquo;other from Walls, about Mrs. South&rsquo;s <a
name="citation401e"></a><a href="#footnote401e"
class="citation">[401e]</a> salary, and his own pension of
&pound;18 for his tithe of the park.&nbsp; I will do nothing in
either; the first I cannot serve in, and the other is a trifle;
only you may tell him I had his letter, and will speak to Ned
Southwell about what he desires me.&nbsp; You say nothing of your
Dean&rsquo;s receiving my letter.&nbsp; I find Clements, <a
name="citation401f"></a><a href="#footnote401f"
class="citation">[401f]</a> whom I recommended to Lord Anglesea
last year, at Walls&rsquo;s desire, or rather the Bishop of
Clogher&rsquo;s, is mightily in Lord Anglesea&rsquo;s
favour.&nbsp; You may tell the Bishop and Walls so; I said to
Lord Anglesea that I was [glad] I had the good luck to recommend
him, etc.&nbsp; I dined in the City with my printer, to consult
with him about some papers Lord Treasurer gave <a
name="page402"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 402</span>me last
night, as he always does, too late; however, I will do something
with them.&nbsp; My third cold is a little better; I never had
anything like it before, three colds successively; I hope I shall
have the fourth. <a name="citation402a"></a><a
href="#footnote402a" class="citation">[402a]</a>&nbsp; Those
messengers come from Holland to-day, and they brought over the
six packets that were due.&nbsp; I know not the particulars yet,
for when I was with the Secretary at noon they were just opening;
but one thing I find, that the Dutch are playing us tricks, and
tampering with the French; they are dogs; I shall know more
tomollow . . . MD. <a name="citation402b"></a><a
href="#footnote402b" class="citation">[402b]</a></p>
<p>13.&nbsp; I dined to-day privately with my friend Lewis, at
his lodgings, to consult about some observations on the Barrier
Treaty.&nbsp; Our news from Holland is not good.&nbsp; The French
raise difficulties, and make such offers to the Allies as cannot
be accepted.&nbsp; And the Dutch are uneasy that we are likely to
get anything for ourselves; and the Whigs are glad at all
this.&nbsp; I came home early, and have been very busy three or
four hours.&nbsp; I had a letter from Dr. Pratt <a
name="citation402c"></a><a href="#footnote402c"
class="citation">[402c]</a> to-day by a private hand,
recommending the bearer to me, for something that I shall not
trouble myself about.&nbsp; Wesley <a name="citation402d"></a><a
href="#footnote402d" class="citation">[402d]</a> writ to
recommend the same fellow to me.&nbsp; His expression is that,
hearing I am acquainted with my Lord Treasurer, he desires I
would do so and so: a matter of nothing.&nbsp; What puppies are
mankind!&nbsp; I hope I shall be wiser when I have once done with
Courts.&nbsp; I think you han&rsquo;t troubled me much with your
recommendations.&nbsp; I would do you all the saavis <a
name="citation402e"></a><a href="#footnote402e"
class="citation">[402e]</a> I could.</p>
<p>Pray have you got your aplon, <a name="citation402f"></a><a
href="#footnote402f" class="citation">[402f]</a> maram Ppt?&nbsp;
I paid for it but yesterday; that puts me in mind of it.&nbsp; I
writ an inventory of what things I sent by Leigh in one of my
letters; did you compare it with what you got?&nbsp; I hear
nothing of your cards now; do you never play?&nbsp; Yes, at
Ballygall.&nbsp; Go to bed.&nbsp; Nite, deelest MD. <a

<p><a name="page403"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
403</span>14.&nbsp; Our Society dined to-day at Mr.
Secretary&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; I went there at four; but hearing
the House of Commons would sit late upon the Barrier Treaty, I
went for an hour to Kensington, to see Lord Masham&rsquo;s
children.&nbsp; My young nephew, <a name="citation403a"></a><a
href="#footnote403a" class="citation">[403a]</a> his son of six
months old, has got a swelling in his neck; I fear it is the
evil.&nbsp; We did not go to dinner till eight at night, and I
left them at ten.&nbsp; The Commons have been very severe on the
Barrier Treaty, as you will find by their votes.&nbsp; A Whig
member took out the <i>Conduct of the Allies</i>, and read that
passage about the succession with great resentment; but none
seconded him.&nbsp; The Church party carried every vote by a
great majority.&nbsp; The A.B. <a name="citation403b"></a><a
href="#footnote403b" class="citation">[403b]</a> Dublin is so
railed at by all who come from Ireland that I can defend him no
longer.&nbsp; Lord Anglesea assured me that the story of applying
Piso out of Tacitus <a name="citation403c"></a><a
href="#footnote403c" class="citation">[403c]</a> to Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s being wounded is true.&nbsp; I believe the Duke
of Beaufort will be admitted to our Society next meeting.&nbsp;
To-day I published the <i>Fable of Midas</i>, <a
name="citation403d"></a><a href="#footnote403d"
class="citation">[403d]</a> a poem, printed in a loose half-sheet
of paper.&nbsp; I know not how it will sell; but it passed
wonderfully at our Society to-night; and Mr. Secretary read it
before me the other night to Lord Treasurer, at Lord
Masham&rsquo;s, where they equally approved of it.&nbsp; Tell me
how it passes with you.&nbsp; I think this paper is larger than
ordinary; for here is six days&rsquo; journal, and no nearer the
bottom.&nbsp; I fear these journals are very dull.&nbsp; Nite my
deelest lives.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; Mr. Lewis and I dined by invitation with a Scotch
acquaintance, after I had been very busy in my chamber till two
afternoon.&nbsp; My third cold is now very troublesome on my
breast, especially in the morning.&nbsp; This is a great
revolution in my health; colds never used to return so soon with
me, or last so long.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very surprising this news
<a name="page404"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 404</span>to-day
of the Dauphin and Dauphiness both dying within six days.&nbsp;
They say the old King is almost heart-broke.&nbsp; He has had
prodigious mortifications in his family.&nbsp; The Dauphin has
left two little sons, of four and two years old; the eldest is
sick.&nbsp; There is a foolish story got about the town that Lord
Strafford, one of our Plenipotentiaries, is in the interests of
France; and it has been a good while said that Lord Privy Seal <a
name="citation404a"></a><a href="#footnote404a"
class="citation">[404a]</a> and he do not agree very well.&nbsp;
They are both long practised in business, but neither of them of
much parts.&nbsp; Strafford has some life and spirit, but is
infinitely proud, and wholly illiterate.&nbsp; Nite, MD.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; I dined to-day in the City with my printer, to
finish something I am doing about the Barrier Treaty; <a
name="citation404b"></a><a href="#footnote404b"
class="citation">[404b]</a> but it is not quite done.&nbsp; I
went this evening to Lord Masham&rsquo;s, where Lord Treasurer
sat with us till past twelve.&nbsp; The Lords have voted an
Address to the Queen, to tell her they are not satisfied with the
King of France&rsquo;s offers.&nbsp; The Whigs brought it in of a
sudden; and the Court could not prevent it, and therefore did not
oppose it.&nbsp; The House of Lords is too strong in Whigs,
notwithstanding the new creations; for they are very diligent,
and the Tories as lazy: the side that is down has always most
industry.&nbsp; The Whigs intended to have made a vote that would
reflect on Lord Treasurer; but their project was not ripe.&nbsp;
I hit my face such a rap by calling the coach to stop to-night,
that it is plaguy sore, the bone beneath the eye.&nbsp; Nite dee
logues.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; The Court was mighty full to-day, and has been these
many Sundays; but the Queen was not at chapel.&nbsp; She has got
a little fit of the gout in her foot.&nbsp; The good of going to
Court is that one sees all one&rsquo;s acquaintance, whom
otherwise I should hardly meet twice a year.&nbsp; Prince Eugene
dines with the Secretary to-day, with about seven or eight
General Officers, or foreign Ministers.&nbsp; They will be all
drunk, I am sure.&nbsp; I never was in company with this Prince:
I have proposed to some lords that we should have a sober meal <a
name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 405</span>with him;
but I can&rsquo;t compass it.&nbsp; It is come over in the Dutch
news prints that I was arrested on an action of twenty thousand
pounds by the Duke of Marlborough.&nbsp; I did not like my Court
invitation to-day; so Sir Andrew Fountaine and I went and dined
with Mrs. Van.&nbsp; I came home at six, and have been very busy
till this minute, and it is past twelve.&nbsp; So I got into bed
to write to MD . . . MD. <a name="citation405a"></a><a
href="#footnote405a" class="citation">[405a]</a>&nbsp; We reckon
the Dauphin&rsquo;s death will put forward the peace a good
deal.&nbsp; Pray is Dr. Griffith <a name="citation405b"></a><a
href="#footnote405b" class="citation">[405b]</a> reconciled to me
yet?&nbsp; Have I done enough to soften him? . . . <a
name="citation405c"></a><a href="#footnote405c"
class="citation">[405c]</a>&nbsp; Nite deelest logues.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; Lewis had Guiscard&rsquo;s picture: he bought it,
and offered it to Lord Treasurer, who promised to send for it,
but never did; so I made Lewis give it me, and I have it in my
room; and now Lord Treasurer says he will take it from me: is
that fair?&nbsp; He designs to have it at length in the clothes
he was when he did the action, and a penknife in his hand; and
Kneller is to copy it from this that I have.&nbsp; I intended to
dine with Lord Treasurer to-day, but he has put me off till
to-morrow; so I dined with Lord Dupplin.&nbsp; You know Lord
Dupplin very well; he is a brother of the Society.&nbsp; Well,
but I have received a letter from the Bishop of Cloyne, to
solicit an affair for him with Lord Treasurer, and with the
Parliament, which I will do as soon as fly.&nbsp; I am not near
so keen about other people&rsquo;s affairs as . . . <a
name="citation405d"></a><a href="#footnote405d"

class="citation">[405e]</a> MD: faith, and so I do.&nbsp; I doubt
you have been in pain about the report of my being
arrested.&nbsp; The pamphleteers have let me alone this month,
which is a great wonder: only the third part of the <i>Answer to
the Conduct</i>, which is lately come out.&nbsp; (Did I tell you
of it already?)&nbsp; The House of Commons <a
name="page406"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 406</span>goes on in
mauling the late Ministry and their proceedings.&nbsp; Nite
deelest MD. <a name="citation406a"></a><a href="#footnote406a"
class="citation">[406a]</a></p>
<p>19.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Treasurer to-day, and sat with him
till ten, in spite of my teeth, though my printer waited for me
to correct a sheet.&nbsp; I told him of four lines I writ
extempore with my pencil, on a bit of paper in his house, while
he lay wounded.&nbsp; Some of the servants, I suppose, made
waste-paper of them, and he never had heard of them.&nbsp; Shall
I tell them you?&nbsp; They were inscribed to Mr. Harley&rsquo;s
physician.&nbsp; Thus</p>
<blockquote><p>On Britain Europe&rsquo;s safety lies; <a
name="citation406b"></a><a href="#footnote406b"
class="citation">[406b]</a><br />
Britain is lost, if Harley dies.<br />
Harley depends upon your skill:<br />
Think what you save, or what you kill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are not they well enough to be done off-hand; for that is the
meaning of the word extempore, which you did not know, did
you?&nbsp; I proposed that some company should dine with him on
the 8th of March, which was the day he was wounded, but he says
he designs that the Lords of the Cabinet, who then sat with him,
should dine that day with him: <a name="citation406c"></a><a
href="#footnote406c" class="citation">[406c]</a> however, he has
invited me too.&nbsp; I am not got rid of my cold; it plagues me
in the morning chiefly.&nbsp; Nite, MD.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; After waiting to catch the Secretary coming out from
Sir Thomas Hanmer, for two hours, in vain, about some business, I
went into the City to my printer, to correct some sheets of the
<i>Barrier Treaty and Remarks</i>, which must be finished
to-morrow: I have been horrible busy for some days past, with
this and some other things; and I wanted some very necessary
papers, which the Secretary was to give me, and the pamphlet must
now be published without them.&nbsp; But they are all busy
too.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Hanmer is Chairman of the Committee for
drawing up a Representation of the state of the nation <a
name="citation406d"></a><a href="#footnote406d"
class="citation">[406d]</a> to the Queen, where all the wrong <a
name="page407"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 407</span>steps of
the Allies and late Ministry about the war will be
mentioned.&nbsp; The Secretary, I suppose, was helping him about
it to-day; I believe it will be a pepperer.&nbsp; Nite, deel
MD.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; I have been six hours to-day morning writing
nineteen pages of a letter to Lord Treasurer, about forming a
Society or Academy to correct and fix the English language. <a
name="citation407a"></a><a href="#footnote407a"
class="citation">[407a]</a>&nbsp; (Is English a speech or a
language?)&nbsp; It will not be above five or six more.&nbsp; I
will send it to him to-morrow, and will print it, if he desires
me.&nbsp; I dined, you know, with our Society to-day: Thursday is
our day.&nbsp; We had a new member admitted; it was the Duke of
Beaufort.&nbsp; We had thirteen met: brother Ormond was not
there, but sent his excuse that Prince Eugene dined with
him.&nbsp; I left them at seven, being engaged to go to Sir
Thomas Hanmer, who desired I would see him at that hour.&nbsp;
His business was that I would <i>hoenlbp ihainm itavoi dsroanws

name="citation407b"></a><a href="#footnote407b"
class="citation">[407b]</a> which I consented to do; but know not
whether I shall succeed, because it is a little out of my
way.&nbsp; However, I have taken my share.&nbsp; Nite, MD.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; I finished the rest of my letter to Lord Treasurer
to-day, and sent it to him about one o&rsquo;clock; and then
dined privately with my friend Mr. Lewis, to talk over some
affairs of moment.&nbsp; I had gotten the thirteenth volume of
Rymer&rsquo;s Collection of the Records of the Tower for the
University of Dublin. <a name="citation407c"></a><a
href="#footnote407c" class="citation">[407c]</a>&nbsp; I have two
volumes now.&nbsp; I will write to the Provost, to know how I
shall send them to him; no, I won&rsquo;t, for I will bring them
myself among my own books.&nbsp; I was with Hanmer this morning,
and there were the Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer <a
name="citation407d"></a><a href="#footnote407d"
class="citation">[407d]</a> very busy with him, laying their
heads together about the representation.&nbsp; I went to Lord
Masham&rsquo;s to-night, and Lady Masham made me read to her a
pretty twopenny pamphlet, called <i>The St. Albans </i><a
name="page408"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
408</span><i>Ghost</i>. <a name="citation408a"></a><a
href="#footnote408a" class="citation">[408a]</a>&nbsp; I thought
I had writ it myself; so did they; but I did not.&nbsp; Lord
Treasurer came down to us from the Queen, and we stayed till two
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; That is the best night-place I have.&nbsp;
The usual <a name="citation408b"></a><a href="#footnote408b"
class="citation">[408b]</a> company are Lord and Lady Masham,
Lord Treasurer, Dr. Arbuthnot, and I; sometimes the Secretary,
and sometimes Mrs. Hill of the bed-chamber, Lady Masham&rsquo;s

know where I shall dine.&nbsp; I hear the Secretary is a little
out of order; perhaps I may dine there, perhaps not.&nbsp; I sent
Hanmer what he wanted from me, I know not how he will approve of
it.&nbsp; I was to do more of the same sort; I am going out, and
must carry zis in my pottick to give it at some general

href="#footnote408e" class="citation">[408e]</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Feb.</i> 23, 1711&ndash;12.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> having disposed my last
letter in the post-office, I am now to begin this with telling MD
that I dined with the Secretary to-day, who is much out of order
with a cold, and feverish; yet he went to the Cabinet Council
to-night at six, against my will.&nbsp; The Secretary is much the
<a name="page409"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 409</span>greatest
commoner in England, and turns the whole Parliament, who can do
nothing without him; and if he lives and has his health, will, I
believe, be one day at the head of affairs.&nbsp; I have told him
sometimes that, if I were a dozen years younger, I would
cultivate his favour, and trust my fortune with his.&nbsp; But
what care oo for all this?&nbsp; I am sorry when I came first
acquainted with this Ministry that I did not send you their names
and characters, and then you would have relished what <a
name="citation409a"></a><a href="#footnote409a"
class="citation">[409a]</a> I would have writ, especially if I
had let you into the particulars of affairs: but enough of
this.&nbsp; Nite, deelest logues.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; I went early this morning to the Secretary, who is
not yet well.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Hanmer and the Chancellor of the
Exchequer came while I was there, and he would not let me stir;
so I did not go to church, but was busy with them till noon,
about the affair I told you in my last.&nbsp; The other two went
away; and I dined with the Secretary, and found my head very much
out of order, but no absolute fit; and I have not been well all
this day.&nbsp; It has shook me a little.&nbsp; I sometimes sit
up very late at Lord Masham&rsquo;s, and have writ much for
several days past: but I will amend both; for I have now very
little business, and hope I shall have no more, and I am resolved
to be a great rider this summer in Ireland.&nbsp; I was to see
Mrs. Wesley this evening, who has been somewhat better for this
month past, and talks of returning to the Bath in a few
weeks.&nbsp; Our peace goes on but slowly; the Dutch are playing
tricks, and we do not push it strongly as we ought.&nbsp; The
fault of our Court is delay, of which the Queen has a great deal;
and Lord Treasurer is not without his share.&nbsp; But pay richar
MD ret us know a little of your life and tonvelsasens. <a
name="citation409b"></a><a href="#footnote409b"
class="citation">[409b]</a>&nbsp; Do you play at ombre, or visit
the Dean, and Goody Walls and Stoytes and Manleys, as
usual?&nbsp; I must have a letter from oo, to fill the other side
of this sheet.&nbsp; Let me know what you do.&nbsp; Is my aunt
alive yet?</p>
<p>Oh, pray, now I think of it, be so kind to step to my aunt, <a
name="page410"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 410</span>and take
notice of my great-grandfather&rsquo;s picture; you know he has a
ring on his finger, with a seal of an anchor and dolphin about
it; but I think there is besides, at the bottom of the picture,
the same coat of arms quartered with another, which I suppose was
my great-grandmother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If this be so, it is a
stronger argument than the seal.&nbsp; And pray see whether you
think that coat of arms was drawn at the same time with the
picture, or whether it be of a later hand; and ask my aunt what
she knows about it.&nbsp; But perhaps there is no such coat of
arms on the picture, and I only dreamed it.&nbsp; My reason is,
because I would ask some herald here, whether I should choose
that coat, or one in Guillim&rsquo;s large folio of heraldry, <a
name="citation410a"></a><a href="#footnote410a"
class="citation">[410a]</a> where my uncle Godwin is named with
another coat of arms of three stags.&nbsp; This is sad stuff to
rite; so nite, MD.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; I was this morning again with the Secretary, and we
were two hours busy; and then went together to the Park, Hyde
Park, I mean; and he walked to cure his cold, and we were looking
at two Arabian horses sent some time ago to Lord Treasurer. <a
name="citation410b"></a><a href="#footnote410b"
class="citation">[410b]</a>&nbsp; The Duke of Marlborough&rsquo;s
coach overtook us, with his Grace and Lord Godolphin in it; but
they did not see us, to our great satisfaction; for neither of us
desired that either of those two lords should see us
together.&nbsp; There was half a dozen ladies riding like
cavaliers to take the air.&nbsp; My head is better to-day.&nbsp;
I dined with the Secretary; but we did no business after dinner,
and at six I walked into the fields; the days are grown pure and
long; then I went to visit Perceval <a name="citation410c"></a><a
href="#footnote410c" class="citation">[410c]</a> and his family,
whom I had seen but twice since they came to town.&nbsp; They too
are going to the Bath next month.&nbsp; Countess Doll of Meath <a
name="citation410d"></a><a href="#footnote410d"
class="citation">[410d]</a> is such an owl that, <a
name="page411"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 411</span>wherever I
visit, people are asking me whether I know such an Irish lady,
and her figure and her foppery?&nbsp; I came home early, and have
been amusing myself with looking into one of Rymer&rsquo;s
volumes of the Records of the Tower, and am mighty easy to think
I have no urgent business upon my hands.&nbsp; My third cold is
not yet off; I sometimes cough, and am not right with it in the
morning.&nbsp; Did I tell you that I believe it is Lady
Masham&rsquo;s hot room that gives it me?&nbsp; I never knew such
a stove; and in my conscience I believe both my lord and she, my
Lord Treasurer, Mr. Secretary, and myself have all suffered by
it.&nbsp; We have all had colds together, but I walk home on
foot.&nbsp; Nite dee logues.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; I was again busy with the Secretary. <a
name="citation411"></a><a href="#footnote411"
class="citation">[411]</a>&nbsp; We read over some papers, and
did a good deal of business; and I dined with him, and we were to
do more business after dinner; but after dinner is after
dinner&mdash;an old saying and a true, &ldquo;much drinking,
little thinking.&rdquo;&nbsp; We had company with us, and nothing
could be done, and I am to go there again to-morrow.&nbsp; I have
now nothing to do; and the Parliament, by the Queen&rsquo;s
recommendation, is to take some method for preventing libels,
etc., which will include pamphlets, I suppose.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what method they will take, but it comes on in a
day or two.&nbsp; To-day in the morning I visited upwards: first
I saw the Duke of Ormond below stairs, and gave him joy of his
being declared General in Flanders; then I went up one pair of
stairs, and sat with the Duchess; then I went up another pair of
stairs, and paid a visit to Lady Betty; and desired her woman to
go up to the garret, that I might pass half an hour with her, but
she was young and handsome, and would not.&nbsp; The Duke is our
President this week, and I have bespoke a small dinner on
purpose, for good example.&nbsp; Nite mi deelest logues.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; I was again with the Secretary this morning; but we
<a name="page412"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 412</span>only
read over some papers with Sir Thomas Hanmer; then I called at
Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s; it was his levee-day, but I went up to
his bed-chamber, and said what I had to say.&nbsp; I came down
and peeped in at the chamber, where a hundred fools were waiting,
and two streets were full of coaches.&nbsp; I dined in the City
with my printer, <a name="citation412a"></a><a
href="#footnote412a" class="citation">[412a]</a> and came back at
six to Lord Treasurer, who had invited me to dinner, but I
refused him.&nbsp; I sat there an hour or two, and then went to
Lord Masham&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They were all abroad: so truly I came,
and read whatever stuff was next me.&nbsp; I can sit and be idle
now, which I have not been above a year past.&nbsp; However, I
will stay out the session, to see if they have any further
commands for me, and that, I suppose, will end in April.&nbsp;
But I may go somewhat before, for I hope all will be ended by
then, and we shall have either a certain peace, or certain
war.&nbsp; The Ministry is contriving new funds for money by
lotteries, and we go on as if the war were to continue, but I
believe it will not.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis pretty late now, ung
oomens; so I bid oo nite, own dee dallars.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; I have been packing up some books in a great box I
have bought, and must buy another for clothes and luggage.&nbsp;
This is a beginning towards a removal.&nbsp; I have sent to
Holland for a dozen shirts, and design to buy another new gown
and hat.&nbsp; I will come over like a zinkerman, <a
name="citation412b"></a><a href="#footnote412b"
class="citation">[412b]</a> and lay out nothing in clothes in
Ireland this good while.&nbsp; I have writ this night to the
Provost.&nbsp; Our Society met to-day as usual, and we were
fourteen, beside the Earl of Arran, <a name="citation412c"></a><a
href="#footnote412c" class="citation">[412c]</a> whom his
brother, the Duke of Ormond, brought among us against all
order.&nbsp; We were mightily shocked; but, after some whispers,
it ended in choosing Lord Arran one of our <a
name="page413"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 413</span>Society,
which I opposed to his face, but it was carried by all the rest
against me.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; This is leap year, and this is leap day.&nbsp;
Prince George was born on this day.&nbsp; People are mistaken;
and some here think it is St. David&rsquo;s Day; but they do not
understand the virtue of leap year.&nbsp; I have nothing to do
now, boys, and have been reading all this day like Gumdragon; and
yet I was dictating some trifles this morning to a printer.&nbsp;
I dined with a friend hard by, and the weather was so
discouraging I could not walk.&nbsp; I came home early, and have
read two hundred pages of Arran.&nbsp; Alexander the Great is
just dead: I do not think he was poisoned; betwixt you and me,
all those are but idle stories: it is certain that neither
Ptolemy nor Aristobulus thought so, and they were both with him
when he <a name="citation413a"></a><a href="#footnote413a"
class="citation">[413a]</a> died.&nbsp; It is a pity we have not
their histories.&nbsp; The Bill for limiting Members of
Parliament to have but so many places passed the House of
Commons, and will pass the House of Lords, in spite of the
Ministry, which you know is a great lessening of the
Queen&rsquo;s power.&nbsp; Four of the new lords voted against
the Court in this point.&nbsp; It is certainly a good Bill in the
reign of an ill prince, but I think things are not settled enough
for it at present.&nbsp; And the Court may want a majority upon a
pinch.&nbsp; Nite deelest logues.&nbsp; Rove Pdfr.</p>
<p>March 1.&nbsp; I went into the City to inquire after poor
Stratford, <a name="citation413b"></a><a href="#footnote413b"
class="citation">[413b]</a> who has put himself a prisoner into
the Queen&rsquo;s Bench, for which his friends blame him much,
because his creditors designed to be very easy with him.&nbsp; He
grasped at too many things together, and that was his ruin.&nbsp;
There is one circumstance relative to Lieutenant-General Meredith
<a name="citation413c"></a><a href="#footnote413c"
class="citation">[413c]</a> that is very melancholy: Meredith was
turned out of all his employments last year, and had about
&pound;10,000 left to live on.&nbsp; Stratford, upon friendship,
desired he might have the management of it for Meredith, to put
it into the stocks and funds for the best advantage, and now he
has lost it all.&nbsp; You have heard me often talk of Stratford;
we were class-fellows <a name="page414"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 414</span>at school and university.&nbsp; I
dined with some merchants, his friends, to-day, and they said
they expected his breaking this good while.&nbsp; I gave him
notice of a treaty of peace, while it was a secret, of which he
might have made good use, but that helped to ruin him; for he
gave money, reckoning there would be actually a peace by this
time, and consequently stocks rise high.&nbsp; Ford narrowly
&rsquo;scaped losing &pound;500 by him, and so did I too.&nbsp;
Nite, my two deelest rives MD.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I was wakened at three this morning,
my man and the people of the house telling me of a great fire in
the Haymarket.&nbsp; I slept again, and two hours after my man
came in again, and told me it was my poor brother Sir William
Wyndham&rsquo;s <a name="citation414a"></a><a
href="#footnote414a" class="citation">[414a]</a> house burnt, and
that two maids, leaping out of an upper room to avoid the fire,
both fell on their heads, one of them upon the iron spikes before
the door, and both lay dead in the streets.&nbsp; It is supposed
to have been some carelessness of one or both those maids.&nbsp;
The Duke of Ormond was there helping to put out the fire.&nbsp;
Brother Wyndham gave &pound;6,000 but a few months ago for that
house, as he told me, and it was very richly furnished.&nbsp; I
shall know more particulars at night.&nbsp; He married Lady
Catherine Seymour, the Duke of Somerset&rsquo;s daughter; you
know her, I believe.&mdash;At night.&nbsp; Wyndham&rsquo;s young
child escaped very narrowly; Lady Catherine escaped barefoot;
they all went to Northumberland House.&nbsp; Mr. Brydges&rsquo;s
<a name="citation414b"></a><a href="#footnote414b"
class="citation">[414b]</a> house, at next door, is damaged much,
and was like to be burnt.&nbsp; Wyndham has lost above
&pound;10,000 by this accident; his lady above a thousand pounds
worth of clothes.&nbsp; It <a name="page415"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 415</span>was a terrible accident.&nbsp; He
was not at Court to-day.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Masham.&nbsp;
The Queen was not at church.&nbsp; Nite, MD.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Pray tell Walls that I spoke to the Duke of Ormond
and Mr. Southwell about his friend&rsquo;s affair, who, I find,
needed not me for a solicitor, for they both told me the thing
would be done.&nbsp; I likewise mentioned his own affair to Mr.
Southwell, and I hope that will be done too, for Southwell seems
to think it reasonable, and I will mind him of it again.&nbsp;
Tell him this nakedly.&nbsp; You need not know the
particulars.&nbsp; They are secrets: one of them is about Mrs.
South having a pension; the other about his salary from the
Government for the tithes of the park that lie in his parish, to
be put upon the establishment, but oo must not know zees sings,
zey are secrets; and we must keep them flom nauty dallars.&nbsp;
I dined in the City with my printer, with whom I had some small
affair; but I have no large work on my hands now.&nbsp; I was
with Lord Treasurer this morning, and hat <a
name="citation415a"></a><a href="#footnote415a"
class="citation">[415a]</a> care oo for zat?&nbsp; Oo dined with
the Dean to-day.&nbsp; Monday is parson&rsquo;s holiday, and oo
lost oo money at cards and dice; ze Givars <a

bed.&nbsp; Nite, my two deelest logues.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I sat to-day with poor Mrs. Wesley, who made me dine
with her.&nbsp; She is much better than she was.&nbsp; I heartily
pray for her health, out of the entire love I bear to her worthy
husband.&nbsp; This day has passed very insignificantly.&nbsp;
But it is a great comfort to me now that I can come home and
read, and have nothing upon my hands to write.&nbsp; I was at
Lord Masham&rsquo;s to-night, and stayed there till one.&nbsp;
Lord Treasurer was there; but I thought, I thought he looked
melancholy, just as he did at the beginning of the session, and
he was not so merry as usual.&nbsp; In short, the majority in the
House of Lords is a very weak one: and he has much ado to keep it
up; and he is not able to make those removes he would, and oblige
his friends; and I doubt too <a name="citation415c"></a><a
href="#footnote415c" class="citation">[415c]</a> he does not take
care enough about it, or rather cannot do all himself, and will
not <a name="page416"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
416</span>employ others: which is his great fault, as I have
often told you.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis late.&nbsp; Nite, MD.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I wish you a merry Lent.&nbsp; I hate Lent; I hate
different diets, and furmity and butter, and herb porridge; and
sour devout faces of people who only put on religion for seven
weeks.&nbsp; I was at the Secretary&rsquo;s office this morning;
and there a gentleman brought me two letters, dated last October;
one from the Bishop of Clogher, t&rsquo;other from Walls.&nbsp;
The gentleman is called Colonel Newburgh. <a
name="citation416a"></a><a href="#footnote416a"
class="citation">[416a]</a>&nbsp; I think you mentioned him to me
some time ago; he has business in the House of Lords.&nbsp; I
will do him what service I can.&nbsp; The Representation of the
House of Commons is printed: <a name="citation416b"></a><a
href="#footnote416b" class="citation">[416b]</a>&nbsp; I have not
seen it yet; it is plaguy severe, they say.&nbsp; I dined with
Dr. Arbuthnot, and had a true Lenten dinner, not in point of
victuals, but spleen; for his wife and a child or two were sick
in the house, and that was full as mortifying as fish.&nbsp; We
have had fine mighty cold frosty weather for some days
past.&nbsp; I hope you take the advantage of it, and walk now and
then.&nbsp; You never answer that part of my letters where I
desire you to walk.&nbsp; I must keep my breath to cool my Lenten
porridge.&nbsp; Tell Jemmy Leigh that his boy that robbed him now
appears about the town: Patrick has seen him once or twice.&nbsp;
I knew nothing of his being robbed till Patrick told me he had
seen the boy.&nbsp; I wish it had been Sterne that had been
robbed, to be revenged for the box that he lost, <a
name="citation416c"></a><a href="#footnote416c"
class="citation">[416c]</a> and be p-xed to him.&nbsp; Nite,
MD.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I hear Mr. Prior has suffered by Stratford&rsquo;s
breaking.&nbsp; I was yesterday to see Prior, who is not well,
and I thought he looked melancholy.&nbsp; He can ill afford to
lose money.&nbsp; I walked before dinner in the Mall a good while
with Lord Arran and Lord Dupplin, two of my brothers, and then we
went to dinner, where the Duke of Beaufort was our
President.&nbsp; We were but eleven to-day.&nbsp; We are now in
all nine lords and ten commoners.&nbsp; The Duke of Beaufort had
the confidence to propose his brother-in-law, the Earl of <a
name="page417"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 417</span>Danby, <a
name="citation417a"></a><a href="#footnote417a"
class="citation">[417a]</a> to be a member; but I opposed it so
warmly that it was waived.&nbsp; Danby is not above twenty, and
we will have no more boys, and we want but two to make up our
number.&nbsp; I stayed till eight, and then we all went away
soberly.&nbsp; The Duke of Ormond&rsquo;s treat last week cost
&pound;20, though it was only four dishes and four, without a
dessert; and I bespoke it in order to be cheap.&nbsp; Yet I could
not prevail to change the house.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer is in a
rage with us for being so extravagant: and the wine was not
reckoned neither; for that is always brought by him that is
President.&nbsp; Lord Orrery <a name="citation417b"></a><a
href="#footnote417b" class="citation">[417b]</a> is to be
President next week; and I will see whether it cannot be cheaper;
or else we will leave the house. . . . <a
name="citation417c"></a><a href="#footnote417c"
class="citation">[417c]</a>&nbsp; Lord Masham made me go home
with him to-night to eat boiled oysters.&nbsp; Take oysters, wash
them clean; that is, wash their shells clean; then put your
oysters into an earthen pot, with their hollow sides down, then
put this pot into a great kettle with water, and so let them
boil.&nbsp; Your oysters are boiled in their own liquor, and not
mixed water.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer was not with us; he was very
ill to-day with a swimming in the head, and is gone home to be
cupped, and sent to desire Lady Masham to excuse him to the
Queen.&nbsp; Nite, dee MD.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; I was to-day at the House of Lords about a
friend&rsquo;s Bill.&nbsp; Then I crossed the water at
Westminster Stairs to Southwark, went through St. George&rsquo;s
Fields to the Mint, which is the dominion of the King&rsquo;s <a
name="citation417d"></a><a href="#footnote417d"
class="citation">[417d]</a> Bench Prison, where Stratford lodges
in a blind alley, and writ to me to come to him; but he was gone
to the &rsquo;Change.&nbsp; I thought he had something to say to
me about his own affairs.&nbsp; I found him at his usual
coffee-house, and went to his own lodgings, and dined with him
and his wife, and other company.&nbsp; His business was only to
desire I would intercede with the Ministry about his
brother-in-law, Ben Burton, <a name="citation417e"></a><a
href="#footnote417e" class="citation">[417e]</a> of Dublin, the
banker, who is likely to come <a name="page418"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 418</span>into trouble, as we hear, about
spreading false Whiggish news.&nbsp; I hate Burton, and told
Stratford so; and I will advise the Duke of Ormond to make use of
it, to keep the rogue in awe.&nbsp; Mrs. Stratford tells me her
husband&rsquo;s creditors have consented to give him liberty to
get up his debts abroad; and she hopes he will pay them
all.&nbsp; He was cheerfuller than I have seen him this great
while.&nbsp; I have walked much to-day.&mdash;Night, deelest

<p>8.&nbsp; This day twelvemonth Mr. Harley was stabbed; but he
is ill, and takes physic to-day, I hear (&rsquo;tis now morning),
and cannot have the Cabinet Council with him, as he intended, nor
me to say grace.&nbsp; I am going to see him.&nbsp; Pray read the
Representation; &rsquo;tis the finest that ever was writ.&nbsp;
Some of it is Pdfr&rsquo;s style, but not very much.&nbsp; This
is the day of the Queen&rsquo;s accession to the Crown; so it is
a great day.&nbsp; I am going to Court, and will dine with Lord
Masham; but I must go this moment to see the Secretary about some
businesses; so I will seal up this, and put it in the post my own

<h3>LETTER XLIII. <a name="citation418a"></a><a
href="#footnote418a" class="citation">[418a]</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>March</i> 8, 1711&ndash;12.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">carried</span> my forty-second letter in
my pocket till evening, and then put it in the general
post.&mdash;I went in the morning to see Lord Treasurer, who had
taken physic, and was drinking his broth.&nbsp; I had been with
the Secretary before, to recommend a friend, one Dr. Freind, <a
name="citation418b"></a><a href="#footnote418b"
class="citation">[418b]</a> to be Physician-General; and the
Secretary promised to mention it to the Queen.&nbsp; I can serve
everybody but myself.&nbsp; Then I went to Court, and carried
Lord Keeper and the Secretary to dine with Lord Masham, when we
drank the Queen and Lord <a name="page419"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 419</span>Treasurer with every health, because
this was the day of his stabbing.&mdash;Then I went and played
pools at picquet with Lady Masham and Mrs. Hill; won ten
shillings, gave a crown to the box, and came home.&nbsp; I met at
my lodgings a letter from Joe, with a bit annexed from Ppt.&nbsp;
What Joe asks is entirely out of my way, and I take it for a
foolish whim in him.&nbsp; Besides, I know not who is to give a
patent: if the Duke of Ormond, I would speak to him; and if it
come in my head I will mention it to Ned Southwell.&nbsp; They
have no patents that I know of for such things here, but good
security is all; and to think that I would speak to Lord
Treasurer for any such matter at random is a jest.&nbsp; Did I
tell you of a race of rakes, called the Mohocks, <a
name="citation419a"></a><a href="#footnote419a"
class="citation">[419a]</a> that play the devil about this town
every night, slit people&rsquo;s noses, and beat them,
etc.?&nbsp; Nite, sollahs, and rove Pdfr.&nbsp; Nite, MD.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; I was at Court to-day, and nobody invited me to
dinner, except one or two, whom I did not care to dine with; so I
dined with Mrs. Van.&nbsp; Young Davenant <a
name="citation419b"></a><a href="#footnote419b"
class="citation">[419b]</a> was telling us at Court how he was
set upon by the Mohocks, and how they ran his chair through with
a sword.&nbsp; It is not safe being in the streets at night for
them.&nbsp; The Bishop of Salisbury&rsquo;s son <a
name="citation419c"></a><a href="#footnote419c"
class="citation">[419c]</a> <a name="page420"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 420</span>is said to be of the gang.&nbsp;
They are all Whigs; and a great lady sent to me, to speak to her
father and to Lord Treasurer, to have a care of them, and to be
careful likewise of myself; for she heard they had malicious
intentions against the Ministers and their friends.&nbsp; I know
not whether there be anything in this, though others are of the
same opinion.&nbsp; The weather still continues very fine and
frosty.&nbsp; I walked in the Park this evening, and came home
early to avoid the Mohocks.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer is better.&nbsp;
Nite, my own two deelest MD.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; I went this morning again to the Lord Treasurer, who
is quite recovered; and I stayed till he went out.&nbsp; I dined
with a friend in the City, about a little business of printing;
but not my own.&nbsp; You must buy a small twopenny pamphlet,
called <i>Law is a Bottomless Pit</i>. <a
name="citation420a"></a><a href="#footnote420a"
class="citation">[420a]</a>&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very prettily
written, and there will be a Second Part.&nbsp; The Commons are
very slow in bringing in their Bill to limit the press, and the
pamphleteers make good use of their time; for there come out
three or four every day.&nbsp; Well, but is not it time,
methinks, to have a letter from MD?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis now six
weeks since I had your Number 26.&nbsp; I can assure oo I expect
one before this goes; and I&rsquo;ll make shorter day&rsquo;s
journals than usual, &rsquo;cause I hope to fill up a good deal
of t&rsquo;other side with my answer.&nbsp; Our fine weather
lasts yet, but grows a little windy.&nbsp; We shall have rain
soon, I dispose.&nbsp; Go to cards, sollahs, and I to seep.&nbsp;
Nite, MD.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer has lent the long letter I writ him
<a name="citation420b"></a><a href="#footnote420b"
class="citation">[420b]</a> to Prior, and I can&rsquo;t get Prior
to return it.&nbsp; I want to have it printed, and to make up
this Academy for the improvement of our language.&nbsp; Faith, we
never shall improve it so much as FW has done; sall we?&nbsp; No,
faith, ourrichar gangridge. <a name="citation420c"></a><a
href="#footnote420c" class="citation">[420c]</a>&nbsp; I dined
privately with my friend Lewis, and then went to see Ned
Southwell, and talk with him about Walls&rsquo;s business, and <a
name="page421"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 421</span>Mrs.
South&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The latter will be done; but his own
not.&nbsp; Southwell tells me that it must be laid before Lord
Treasurer, and the nature of it explained, and a great deal of
clutter, which is not worth the while; and maybe Lord Treasurer
won&rsquo;t do it [at] last; and it is, as Walls says himself,
not above forty shillings a year difference.&nbsp; You must tell
Walls this, unless he would have the business a secret from you:
in that case only say I did all I could with Ned Southwell, and
it can&rsquo;t be done; for it must be laid before Lord
Treasurer, etc., who will not do it; and besides, it is not worth
troubling his lordship.&nbsp; So nite, my two deelest nuntyes
nine MD. <a name="citation421a"></a><a href="#footnote421a"
class="citation">[421a]</a></p>
<p>12.&nbsp; Here is the D&mdash; and all to do with these
Mohocks.&nbsp; Grub Street papers about them fly like lightning,
and a list printed of near eighty put into several prisons, and
all a lie; and I begin almost to think there is no truth, or very
little, in the whole story.&nbsp; He that abused Davenant was a
drunken gentleman; none of that gang.&nbsp; My man tells me that
one of the lodgers heard in a coffee-house, publicly, that one
design of the Mohocks was upon me, if they could catch me; and
though I believe nothing of it, I forbear walking late, and they
have put me to the charge of some shillings already.&nbsp; I
dined to-day with Lord Treasurer and two gentlemen of the
Highlands of Scotland, yet very polite men.&nbsp; I sat there
till nine, and then went to Lord Masham&rsquo;s, where Lord
Treasurer followed me, and we sat till twelve; and I came home in
a chair for fear of the Mohocks, and I have given him warning of
it too.&nbsp; Little Harrison, <a name="citation421b"></a><a
href="#footnote421b" class="citation">[421b]</a> whom I sent to
Holland, is now actually made Queen&rsquo;s Secretary at The
Hague.&nbsp; It will be in the <i>Gazette</i> to-morrow.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis worth twelve hundred pounds a year.&nbsp; Here is a
young fellow has writ some Sea Eclogues, poems of Mermen,
resembling pastorals of shepherds, and they are very pretty, and
the thought is new.&nbsp; Mermen are he-mermaids; Tritons,
natives of the sea.&nbsp; Do you understand me?&nbsp; I think to
recommend <a name="page422"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
422</span>him to our Society to-morrow.&nbsp; His name is Diaper.
<a name="citation422a"></a><a href="#footnote422a"
class="citation">[422a]</a>&nbsp; P&mdash; on him, I must do
something for him, and get him out of the way.&nbsp; I hate to
have any new wits rise, but when they do rise I would encourage
them; but they tread on our heels and thrust us off the
stage.&nbsp; Nite deelest MD.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; You would laugh to see our printer constantly
attending our Society after dinner, and bringing us whatever new
thing he has printed, which he seldom fails to do.&nbsp; Yet he
had nothing to-day.&nbsp; Lord Lansdowne, one of our Society, was
offended at a passage in this day&rsquo;s <i>Examiner</i>, which
he thinks reflects on him, as I believe it does, though in a
mighty civil way.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only that his underlings
cheat; but that he is a very fine gentleman every way, etc. <a
name="citation422b"></a><a href="#footnote422b"
class="citation">[422b]</a>&nbsp; Lord Orrery was President
to-day; but both our dukes were absent.&nbsp; Brother Wyndham
recommended Diaper to the Society.&nbsp; I believe we shall make
a contribution among ourselves, which I don&rsquo;t like.&nbsp;
Lord Treasurer has yet done nothing for us, but we shall try him
soon.&nbsp; The company parted early, but Freind, and Prior, and
I, sat a while longer and reformed the State, and found fault
with the Ministry.&nbsp; Prior hates his Commission of the
Customs, because it spoils his wit.&nbsp; He says he dreams of
nothing but cockets, <a name="citation422c"></a><a
href="#footnote422c" class="citation">[422c]</a> and dockets, and
drawbacks, and other jargon words of the custom-house.&nbsp; Our
good weather went away yesterday, and the nights are now dark,
and I came home before ten.&nbsp; Night nown . . . deelest
sollahs.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; I have been plagued this morning with solicitors,
and with nobody more than my brother, Dr. Freind, who must needs
have to get old Dr. Lawrence, <a name="citation422d"></a><a
href="#footnote422d" class="citation">[422d]</a> the
Physician-General, <a name="page423"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
423</span>turned out and himself in.&nbsp; He has argued with me
so long upon the reasonableness of it, that I am fully convinced
it is very unreasonable; and so I would tell the Secretary, if I
had not already made him speak to the Queen.&nbsp; Besides, I
know not but my friend Dr. Arbuthnot would be content to have it
himself, and I love him ten times better than Freind.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s all this to you? but I must talk of things as they
happen in the day, whether you know anything of them or no.&nbsp;
I dined in the City, and, coming back, one Parson Richardson <a
name="citation423a"></a><a href="#footnote423a"
class="citation">[423a]</a> of Ireland overtook me.&nbsp; He was
here last summer upon a project of converting the Irish and
printing Bibles, etc., in that language, and is now returned to
pursue it on.&nbsp; He tells me Dr. Coghill <a
name="citation423b"></a><a href="#footnote423b"
class="citation">[423b]</a> came last night [to] town.&nbsp; I
will send to see how he does to-morrow.&nbsp; He gave me a letter
from Walls about his old business.&nbsp; Nite, deelest MD.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; I had intended to be early with the Secretary this
morning, when my man admitted upstairs one Mr. Newcomb, <a
name="citation423c"></a><a href="#footnote423c"
class="citation">[423c]</a> an officer, who brought me a letter
from the Bishop of Clogher, with four lines added by Mrs. Ashe,
all about that Newcomb.&nbsp; I think, indeed, his case is hard,
but God knows whether I shall be able to do him any
service.&nbsp; People will not understand: I am a very good
second, but I care not to begin a recommendation, unless it be
for an intimate friend.&nbsp; However, I will do what I
can.&nbsp; I missed the Secretary, and then walked to Chelsea to
dine with the Dean of Christ Church, <a
name="citation423d"></a><a href="#footnote423d"
class="citation">[423d]</a> who was engaged to Lord Orrery with
some other Christ Church men.&nbsp; He made me go with him
whether I would or not, for they have this long time admitted me
a Christ Church man.&nbsp; Lord Orrery, generally every winter,
gives his old acquaintance of that college a <a
name="page424"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
424</span>dinner.&nbsp; There were nine clergymen at table, and
four laymen.&nbsp; The Dean and I soon left them, and after a
visit or two, I went to Lord Masham&rsquo;s, and Lord Treasurer,
Arbuthnot and I sat till twelve.&nbsp; And now I am come home and
got to bed.&nbsp; I came afoot, but had my man with me.&nbsp;
Lord Treasurer advised me not to go in a chair, because the
Mohocks insult chairs more than they do those on foot.&nbsp; They
think there is some mischievous design in those villains.&nbsp;
Several of them, Lord Treasurer told me, are actually taken
up.&nbsp; I heard at dinner that one of them was killed last
night.&nbsp; We shall know more in a little time.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t like them, as the men said. <a
name="citation424a"></a><a href="#footnote424a"
class="citation">[424a]</a>&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; This morning, at the Secretary&rsquo;s, I met
General Ross, <a name="citation424b"></a><a href="#footnote424b"
class="citation">[424b]</a> and recommended Newcomb&rsquo;s case
to him, who promises to join with me in working up the Duke of
Ormond to do something for him.&nbsp; Lord Winchelsea <a
name="citation424c"></a><a href="#footnote424c"
class="citation">[424c]</a> told me to-day at Court that two of
the Mohocks caught a maid of old Lady Winchelsea&rsquo;s, <a
name="citation424d"></a><a href="#footnote424d"
class="citation">[424d]</a> at the door of their house in the
Park, where she was with a candle, and had just lighted out
somebody.&nbsp; They cut all her face, and beat her without any
provocation.&nbsp; I hear my friend Lewis has got a Mohock in one
of the messenger&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; The Queen was at church
to-day, but was carried in an open chair.&nbsp; She has got an
ugly cough, Arbuthnot, her physician, says.&nbsp; I dined with
Crowe, <a name="citation424e"></a><a href="#footnote424e"
class="citation">[424e]</a> late Governor of Barbados; an
acquaintance of Sterne&rsquo;s. <a name="citation424f"></a><a
href="#footnote424f" class="citation">[424f]</a>&nbsp; After
dinner I asked him whether he had heard of Sterne.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;at the door in a
coach:&rdquo; and in came Sterne.&nbsp; He has been here this
week.&nbsp; He is buying a captainship in his cousin
Sterne&rsquo;s <a name="citation424g"></a><a href="#footnote424g"
class="citation">[424g]</a> regiment.&nbsp; He told me he left
Jemmy Leigh playing at cards with you.&nbsp; He is to give 800
guineas for his commission.&nbsp; I suppose you know all this
better than <a name="page425"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
425</span>I.&nbsp; How shall I have room to answer oo rettle <a
name="citation425a"></a><a href="#footnote425a"
class="citation">[425a]</a> hen I get it, I have gone so far
already?&nbsp; Nite, deelest logues MD.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; Dr. Sacheverell came this morning to give me thanks
for getting his brother an employment.&nbsp; It was but six or
seven weeks since I spoke to Lord Treasurer for him.&nbsp;
Sacheverell brought Trapp <a name="citation425b"></a><a
href="#footnote425b" class="citation">[425b]</a> along with
him.&nbsp; We dined together at my printer&rsquo;s, and I sat
with them till seven.&nbsp; I little thought, and I believe so
did he, that ever I should be his solicitor to the present
Ministry, when I left Ireland.&nbsp; This is the seventh I have
now provided for since I came, and can do nothing for
myself.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care; I shall have Ministries and
other people obliged to me.&nbsp; Trapp is a coxcomb, and the
t&rsquo;other is not very deep; and their judgment in things of
wit or sense is miraculous.&nbsp; The Second <i>Part of Law is a
Bottomless Pit</i> <a name="citation425c"></a><a
href="#footnote425c" class="citation">[425c]</a> is just now
printed, and better, I think, than the first.&nbsp; Night, my two
deel saucy dallars.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; There is a proclamation out against the
Mohocks.&nbsp; One of those that are taken is a baronet.&nbsp; I
dined with poor Mrs. Wesley, who is returning to the Bath.&nbsp;
Mrs. Perceval&rsquo;s <a name="citation425d"></a><a
href="#footnote425d" class="citation">[425d]</a> young daughter
has got the smallpox, but will do well.&nbsp; I walked this
evening in the Park, and met Prior, who made me go home with him,
where I stayed till past twelve, and could not get a coach, and
was alone, and was afraid enough of the Mohocks.&nbsp; I will do
so no more, though I got home safe.&nbsp; Prior and I were
talking discontentedly of some managements, that no more people
are turned out, which get Lord Treasurer many enemies: but
whether the fault be in him, or the Queen, I know not; I doubt,
in both.&nbsp; Ung omens, it is now seven weeks since I received
your last; but I expect one next Irish packet, to fill the rest
of this paper; but if it don&rsquo;t come, I&rsquo;ll do without
it: so I wish oo good luck at ombre with the Dean.&nbsp; Nite,

426</span>19.&nbsp; Newcomb came to me this morning, and I went
to the Duke of Ormond to speak for him; but the Duke was just
going out to take the oaths for General.&nbsp; The Duke of
Shrewsbury is to be Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.&nbsp; I walked
with Domville and Ford to Kensington, where we dined, and it cost
me above a crown.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like it, as the man said.
<a name="citation426a"></a><a href="#footnote426a"
class="citation">[426a]</a>&nbsp; It was very windy
walking.&nbsp; I saw there Lord Masham&rsquo;s children.&nbsp;
The youngest, my nephew, I fear, has got the king&rsquo;s evil;
the other two are daughters of three and four years old.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas very windy walking.&nbsp; The gardens there are
mighty fine.&nbsp; I passed the evening at Lord Masham&rsquo;s
with Lord Treasurer and Arbuthnot, as usual, and we stayed till
past one; but I had my man to come with me, and at home I found
three letters; one from one Fetherston, a parson, with a
postscript of Tisdall&rsquo;s to recommend him: and Fetherston,
whom I never saw, has been so kind to give me a letter of
attorney to recover a debt for him.&nbsp; Another from Lord
Abercorn, to get him the dukedom of Chatelherault <a
name="citation426b"></a><a href="#footnote426b"
class="citation">[426b]</a> from the King of France; in which I
will do what I can, for his pretensions are very just.&nbsp; The
third, I warrant you, from our MD.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a great stir
this, of getting a dukedom from the King of France: but it is
only to speak to the Secretary, and get the Duke of Ormond to
engage in it, and mention the case to Lord Treasurer, etc., and
this I shall do.&nbsp; Nite deelest richar MD.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; I was with the Duke of Ormond this morning, about
Lord Abercorn, Dr. Freind, and Newcomb.&nbsp; Some will do, and
some will not do; that&rsquo;s wise, marams. <a
name="citation426c"></a><a href="#footnote426c"
class="citation">[426c]</a>&nbsp; The Duke of Shrewsbury is
certainly to be your Governor.&nbsp; I will go in a day or two,
and give the Duchess joy, and recommend the <a
name="page427"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 427</span>Archbishop
of Dublin to her.&nbsp; I writ to the Archbishop, some months
ago, that it would be so, and told him I would speak a good word
for him to the Duchess; and he says he has a great respect for
her, etc.&nbsp; I made our Society change their house, and we met
to-day at the Star and Garter in the Pall Mall.&nbsp; Lord Arran
was President.&nbsp; The other dog was so extravagant in his
bills, that for four dishes and four, first and second course,
without wine or dessert, he charged twenty-one pounds, six
shillings, and eightpence, to the Duke of Ormond.&nbsp; We
design, when all have been Presidents this turn, to turn it into
a reckoning of so much a head; but we shall break up when the
session ends.&nbsp; Nite deelest MD.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; Now I will answer MD&rsquo;s rettle,
N. 27; you that are adding to your number and grumbling, had made
it 26, and then altered <a name="citation427a"></a><a
href="#footnote427a" class="citation">[427a]</a> it to 27.&nbsp;
I believe it is above a month since your last; yes, it is above
seven weeks since I had your last: but I ought to consider that
this was twelve days right, <a name="citation427b"></a><a
href="#footnote427b" class="citation">[427b]</a> so that makes it
pretty even.&nbsp; O, the sirry zade, <a

Ballygall, seeing their friends, and landlord running away.&nbsp;

Wells, <a name="citation427e"></a><a href="#footnote427e"

there anything in the story; and that&rsquo;s enough.&nbsp; It
was not Roper <a name="citation427f"></a><a href="#footnote427f"
class="citation">[427f]</a> sent that news: Roper is my humble
slave.&mdash;Yes, I heard of your resolves, and that Burton was
embroiled.&nbsp; Stratford spoke to me in his behalf; but I said
I hated the rascal.&nbsp; Poor Catherine gone to Wales?&nbsp; But
she will come back again, I hope.&nbsp; I would see her in my

governed like an ass; and she will govern like a lion.&nbsp; Is
not that true, Ppt?&nbsp; Why, Sterne told me he left you at

of his wife being here: it may cost her a c&mdash; <a

commission.&nbsp; Yes, I will bring oo over all the little papers
I can think on.&nbsp; I thought I sent you, by Leigh, all that
were good at that time.&nbsp; The author of the <i>Sea
Eclogues</i> sent books to the Society yesterday, and we gave him
guineas apiece; and, maybe, will do further from him (for him, I
mean).&nbsp; So the Bishop of Clogher, and lady, were your guests
for a night or two.&nbsp; Why, Ppt, you are grown a great
gamester and company keeper.&nbsp; I did say to myself, when I
read those names, just what you guess; and you clear up the
matter wonderfully.&nbsp; You may converse with those two nymphs
if you please, but the &mdash; take me if ever I do.&nbsp; Iss,

many, many years.&nbsp; I doubt the session will not be over till
the end of April; however, I shall not wait for it, if the
Ministry will let me go sooner.&nbsp; I wish I were just now in
my garden at Laracor.&nbsp; I would set out for Dublin early on
Monday, and bring you an account of my young trees, which you are
better acquainted with than the Ministry, and so am I.&nbsp; Oh,
now you have got Number 41, have you so?&nbsp; Why, perhaps, I

<p><span class="smcap">Ugly</span>, nasty weather.&nbsp; I was in
the City to-day with Mrs. Wesley and Mrs. Perceval, to get money
from a banker for Mrs. Wesley, who goes to Bath on

went to see Lord <a name="page430"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

so I went to Lady Masham&rsquo;s, and lost a crown with her at
picquet, and then sat with Lord Masham and Lord Treasurer, etc.,
there till past one; but I had my man with me, to come
home.&nbsp; I gave in my forty-third, and one for the Bishop of
Clogher, to the post-office, as I came from the City; and so oo

day.&nbsp; Our Mohocks are all vanished; however, I shall take
care of my person.&nbsp; Nite my own two deelest nuntyes MD.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; I was this morning, before church, with the
Secretary, about Lord Abercorn&rsquo;s business, and some
others.&nbsp; My soliciting season is come, and will last as long
as the session.&nbsp; I went late to Court, and the company was
almost gone.&nbsp; The Court serves me for a coffee-house; once a
week I meet acquaintance there, that I should not otherwise see
in a quarter.&nbsp; There is a flying report that the French have
offered a cessation of arms, and to give us Dunkirk, and the
Dutch Namur, for security, till the peace is made.&nbsp; The Duke
of Ormond, they say, goes in a week.&nbsp; Abundance of his
equipage is already gone.&nbsp; His <a name="citation430a"></a><a
href="#footnote430a" class="citation">[430a]</a> friends are
afraid the expense of this employment will ruin him, since he
must lose the government of Ireland.&nbsp; I dined privately with
a friend, and refused all dinners offered me at Court; which,
however, were but two, and I did not like either.&nbsp; Did I
tell you of a scoundrel about the Court that sells employments to
ignorant people, and cheats them of their money?&nbsp; He lately
made a bargain for the Vice-Chamberlain&rsquo;s place, for seven
thousand pounds, and had received some guineas earnest; but the
whole thing was discovered t&rsquo;other day, and examination
taken of it by Lord Dartmouth, and I hope he will be
swinged.&nbsp; The Vice-Chamberlain told me several particulars
of it last night at Lord Masham&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Can DD play at

the Duke of Ormond, and left Dick Stewart <a
name="citation431a"></a><a href="#footnote431a"
class="citation">[431a]</a> to do it further.&nbsp; Then I went
to visit the Duchess of Hamilton, who was not awake.&nbsp; So I
went to the Duchess of Shrewsbury, and sat an hour at her
toilet.&nbsp; I talked to her about the Duke&rsquo;s being Lord
Lieutenant.&nbsp; She said she knew nothing of it; but I rallied
her out of that, and she resolves not to stay behind the
Duke.&nbsp; I intend to recommend the Bishop of Clogher to her
for an acquaintance.&nbsp; He will like her very well: she is,
indeed, a most agreeable woman, and a great favourite of
mine.&nbsp; I know not whether the ladies in Ireland will like
her.&nbsp; I was at the Court of Requests, to get some lords to
be at a committee to-morrow, about a friend&rsquo;s Bill: and
then the Duke of Beaufort gave me a poem, finely bound in folio,
printed at Stamford, and writ by a country squire.&nbsp; Lord
Exeter <a name="citation431b"></a><a href="#footnote431b"
class="citation">[431b]</a> desired the Duke to give it the
Queen, because the author is his friend; but the Duke desired I
would let him know whether it was good for anything.&nbsp; I
brought it home, and will return it to-morrow, as the dullest
thing I ever read; and advise the Duke not to present it.&nbsp; I
dined with Domville at his lodgings, by invitation; for he goes
in a few days for Ireland.&nbsp; Nite dee MD.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; There is a mighty feast at a Tory sheriff&rsquo;s
to-day in the City: twelve hundred dishes of meat.&mdash;Above
five lords, and several hundred gentlemen, will be there, and
give four or five guineas apiece, according to custom.&nbsp; Dr.
Coghill and I dined, by invitation, at Mrs. Van&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It
has rained or mizzled all day, as my pockets feel.&nbsp; There
are two new answers come out to the <i>Conduct of the
Allies</i>.&nbsp; The last year&rsquo;s <i>Examiners</i>, printed
together in a small volume, go off but slowly.&nbsp; The printer
over-printed himself by at least a thousand; so soon out of
fashion are party papers, however so well writ.&nbsp; The
<i>Medleys</i> are coming out in the same volume, and perhaps may
sell better.&nbsp; Our news about a cessation of arms begins to
flag, and I have not these three days seen anybody in business to
ask them about it.&nbsp; We <a name="page432"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 432</span>had a terrible fire last night in
Drury Lane, or thereabouts, and three or four people
destroyed.&nbsp; One of the maids of honour has the smallpox; but
the best is, she can lose no beauty; and we have one new handsome
maid of honour.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; I forgot to tell you that on Sunday last, about
seven at night, it lightened above fifty times as I walked the
Mall, which I think is extraordinary at this time of the year,
and the weather was very hot.&nbsp; Had you anything of this in
Dublin?&nbsp; I intended to dine with Lord Treasurer to-day; but
Lord Mansel and Mr. Lewis made me dine with them at Kit
Musgrave&rsquo;s. <a name="citation432a"></a><a
href="#footnote432a" class="citation">[432a]</a>&nbsp; I sat the
evening with Mrs. Wesley, who goes to-morrow morning to the
Bath.&nbsp; She is much better than she was.&nbsp; The news of
the French desiring a cessation of arms, etc., was but town
talk.&nbsp; We shall know in a few days, as I am told, whether
there will be a peace or not.&nbsp; The Duke of Ormond will go in
a week for Flanders, they say.&nbsp; Our Mohocks go on still, and
cut people&rsquo;s faces every night; fais, they shan&rsquo;t cut
mine, I like it better as it is.&nbsp; The dogs will cost me at
least a crown a week in chairs.&nbsp; I believe the souls of your
houghers of cattle have got into them, and now they don&rsquo;t
distinguish between a cow and a Christian.&nbsp; I forgot to wish
you yesterday a happy New Year.&nbsp; You know the twenty-fifth
of March is the first day of the year, and now you must leave off
cards, and put out your fire.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll put out mine the
first of April, cold or not cold.&nbsp; I believe I shall lose
credit with you by not coming over at the beginning of April; but
I hoped the session would be ended, and I must stay till then;
yet I would fain be at the beginning of my willows growing.&nbsp;
Perceval tells me that the quicksets upon the flat in the garden
do not grow so well as those famous ones on the ditch.&nbsp; They
want digging about them.&nbsp; The cherry-trees, by the
river-side, my heart is set upon.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>

Dr. Arthburnett <a name="citation432b"></a><a

ate it at Ozinda&rsquo;s Chocolate-house, <a
name="citation433a"></a><a href="#footnote433a"
class="citation">[433a]</a> just by St. James&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We
were never merrier, nor better company, and did not part till
after eleven.&nbsp; I did not summon Lord Lansdowne: he and I are
fallen out.&nbsp; There was something in an <i>Examiner</i> a
fortnight ago that he thought reflected on the abuses in his
office (he is Secretary at War), and he writ to the Secretary
that he heard I had inserted that paragraph.&nbsp; This I
resented highly, that he should complain of me before he spoke to
me.&nbsp; I sent him a peppering letter, and would not summon him
by a note, as I did the rest; nor ever will have anything to say
to him, till he begs my pardon.&nbsp; I met Lord Treasurer to-day
at Lady Masham&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He would fain have carried me home
to dinner, but I begged his pardon.&nbsp; What! upon a Society
day!&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis rate, sollahs.&nbsp; I
an&rsquo;t dlunk.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; I was with my friend Lewis to-day, getting materials
for a little mischief; and I dined with Lord Treasurer, and three
or four fellows I never saw before.&nbsp; I left them at seven,
and came home, and have been writing to the Archbishop of Dublin,
and cousin Deane, <a name="citation433b"></a><a
href="#footnote433b" class="citation">[433b]</a> in answer to one
of his of four months old, that I spied by chance, routing among

it winches <a name="citation433c"></a><a href="#footnote433c"

<p>29.&nbsp; I am plagued with these pains in my shoulder; I
believe it is rheumatic; I will do something for it
to-night.&nbsp; Mr. Lewis and I dined with Mr. Domville, to take
our leave of him.&nbsp; I drank three or four glasses of
champagne by perfect teasing, though it is bad for my pain; but
if it continue, I will not drink any wine without water till I am
well.&nbsp; The weather is abominably cold and wet.&nbsp; I am
got into bed, and have put some old flannel, for want of new, to
my shoulder, and rubbed it with Hungary water. <a
name="citation434b"></a><a href="#footnote434b"
class="citation">[434b]</a>&nbsp; It is plaguy hard.&nbsp; I
never would drink any wine, if it were not for my head, and
drinking has given me this pain.&nbsp; I will try abstemiousness
for a while.&nbsp; How does MD do now; how does DD and Ppt?&nbsp;
You must know I hate pain, as the old woman said.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;ll try to go seep.&nbsp; My flesh sucks up Hungary water
rarely.&nbsp; My man is an awkward rascal, and makes me
peevish.&nbsp; Do you know that t&rsquo;other day he was forced
to beg my pardon, that he could not shave my head, his hand shook
so?&nbsp; He is drunk every day, and I design to turn him off
soon as ever I get to Ireland.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll write no more
now, but go to sleep, and see whether sleep and flannel will cure
my shoulder.&nbsp; Nite deelest MD.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; I was not able to go to church or Court to-day for
my shoulder.&nbsp; The pain has left my shoulder, and crept to my
neck and collar-bone.&nbsp; It makes me think of poo Ppt&rsquo;s
bladebone.&nbsp; Urge, urge, urge; dogs gnawing.&nbsp; I went in
a chair at two, and dined with Mrs. Van, where I could be easy,
and came back at seven.&nbsp; My Hungary water is gone; <a
name="page435"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 435</span>and
to-night I use spirits of wine, which my landlady tells me is
very good.&nbsp; It has rained terribly all day long, and is

<p>31.&nbsp; April 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.&nbsp; All these days I
have been extremely ill, though I twice crawled out a week ago;
but am now recovering, though very weak.&nbsp; The violence of my
pain abated the night before last: I will just tell you how I
was, and then send away this letter, which ought to have gone
Saturday last.&nbsp; The pain increased with mighty violence in
my left shoulder and collar-bone, and that side my neck.&nbsp; On
Thursday morning appeared great red spots in all those places
where my pain was, and the violence of the pain was confined to
my neck behind, a little on the left side; which was so violent
that I had not a minute&rsquo;s ease, nor hardly a minute&rsquo;s
sleep in three days and nights.&nbsp; The spots increased every
day, and bred little pimples, which are now grown white, and full
of corruption, though small.&nbsp; The red still continues too,
and most prodigious hot and inflamed.&nbsp; The disease is the
shingles.&nbsp; I eat nothing but water-gruel; am very weak; but
out of all violent pain.&nbsp; The doctors say it would have
ended in some violent disease if it had not come out thus.&nbsp;
I shall now recover fast.&nbsp; I have been in no danger of life,
but miserable torture.&nbsp; I must not write too much.&nbsp; So

<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> your twenty-eighth two or
three days ago.&nbsp; I can hardly answer it now.&nbsp; Since my
last I have been extremely ill.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis this day just a
month since I felt a small pain on the tip of my left shoulder,
which grew worse, and spread for six days; then broke all out by
my collar and left side of my neck in monstrous red spots
inflamed, and these grew to small pimples.&nbsp; For four days I
had no rest, nor nights, for a pain in my neck; then I grew a
little better; afterward, where my pains were, a cruel itching
seized me, beyond whatever I could imagine, and kept me awake
several nights.&nbsp; I rubbed it vehemently, but did not scratch
it: then it grew into three or four great sores like blisters,
and run; at last I advised the doctor to use it like a blister,
so I did with melilot <a name="citation436b"></a><a
href="#footnote436b" class="citation">[436b]</a> plasters, which
still run: and am now in pain enough, but am daily mending.&nbsp;
I kept my chamber a fortnight, then went out a day or two, but
then confined myself again.&nbsp; Two days ago I went to a
neighbour to dine, but yesterday again kept at home.&nbsp; To-day
I will venture abroad a little, and hope to be well in a week or
ten days.&nbsp; I never suffered so much in my life.&nbsp; I have
taken my breeches in above two inches, so I am leaner, which
answers one question in your letter.&nbsp; The weather is mighty
fine.&nbsp; I write in the morning, because I am better
then.&nbsp; I will go and try to walk a little.&nbsp; I will give

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>May</i> 10, 1712.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> not yet ease or humour
enough to go on in my journal method, though I have left my
chamber these ten days.&nbsp; My pain continues still in my
shoulder and collar: I keep flannel on it, and rub it with
brandy, and take a nasty diet drink.&nbsp; I still itch terribly,
and have some few pimples; I am weak, and sweat; and then the
flannel makes me mad with itching; but I think my pain
lessens.&nbsp; A journal, while I was sick, would have been a
noble thing, made up of pain and physic, visits, and messages;
the two last were almost as troublesome as the two first.&nbsp;
One good circumstance is that I am grown much leaner.&nbsp; I
believe I told you that I have taken in my breeches two
inches.&nbsp; I had your N. 29 last night.&nbsp; In answer to
your good opinion of my disease, the doctors said they never saw
anything so odd of the kind; they were not properly shingles, but
<i>herpes miliaris</i>, and twenty other hard names.&nbsp; I can
never be sick like other people, but always something out of the
common way; and as for your notion of its coming without pain, it
neither came, nor stayed, nor went without pain, and the most
pain I ever bore in my life.&nbsp; Medemeris <a
name="citation437b"></a><a href="#footnote437b"
class="citation">[437b]</a> is retired in the country, with the
beast her husband, long ago.&nbsp; I thank the Bishop of Clogher
for his proxy; I will write to him soon.&nbsp; Here is
Dilly&rsquo;s wife in town; but I have not seen her yet.&nbsp;
No, sinkerton: <a name="citation437c"></a><a href="#footnote437c"
class="citation">[437c]</a> &rsquo;tis not a sign of health, but
a sign that, if it had not come out, some terrible fit of
sickness would have followed.&nbsp; I was at our Society last
Thursday, to receive a new member, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer; <a name="citation437d"></a><a href="#footnote437d"
class="citation">[437d]</a> but I drink nothing above wine and
water.&nbsp; We shall have a peace, I hope, soon, or at least

a Scotch gentleman, <a name="citation438b"></a><a

mine, that writ it; but they put it upon me.&nbsp; The Parliament
will hardly be up till June.&nbsp; We were like to be undone some
days ago with a tack; but we carried it bravely, and the Whigs
came in to help us.&nbsp; Poor Lady Masham, I am afraid, will
lose her only son, about a twelvemonth old, with the king&rsquo;s
evil.&nbsp; I never would let Mrs. Fenton see me during my
illness, though she often came; but she has been once here since
I recovered.&nbsp; Bernage has been twice to see me of
late.&nbsp; His regiment will be broke, and he only upon
half-pay; so perhaps he thinks he will want me again.&nbsp; I am
told here the Bishop of Clogher and family are coming over, but
he says nothing of it himself.&nbsp; I have been returning the
visits of those that sent howdees <a name="citation438c"></a><a

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>May</i> 31, 1712.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">cannot</span> yet arrive to my journal
letters, my pains continuing still, though with less violence;
but I don&rsquo;t love to write journals while I am in pain; and
above all, not journals to MD.&nbsp; But, however, I am so much
mended, that I intend my next shall be in the old way; and yet I
shall, perhaps, break my resolution when I feel pain.&nbsp; I
believe I have lost credit with you, in relation to my coming
over; but I protest it is impossible for one who has anything to
do with this Ministry to be certain when he fixes any time.&nbsp;
There is a business which, till it take some turn or other, I
cannot leave this place in prudence or honour.&nbsp; And I never
wished so much as now that I had stayed in Ireland; but the die
is cast, and is now a spinning, and till it settles, I cannot
tell whether it be an ace or a sise. <a
name="citation439d"></a><a href="#footnote439d"
class="citation">[439d]</a>&nbsp; I am confident by what you know
yourselves, that you will justify <a name="page440"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 440</span>me in all this.&nbsp; The moment I
am used ill, I will leave them; but know not how to do it while
things are in suspense. The session will soon be over (I believe
in a fortnight), and the peace, we hope, will be made in a short
time; and there will be no further occasion for me; nor have I
anything to trust to but Court gratitude, so that I expect to see
my willows <a name="citation440a"></a><a href="#footnote440a"
class="citation">[440a]</a> a month after the Parliament is up:
but I will take MD in my way, and not go to Laracor like an
unmannerly spraenekich ferrow. <a name="citation440b"></a><a

seen my <i>Letter to Lord Treasurer</i>?&nbsp; There are two
answers come out to it already; <a name="citation440c"></a><a
href="#footnote440c" class="citation">[440c]</a> though it is no
politics, but a harmless proposal about the improvement of the
English Tongue.&nbsp; I believe if I writ an essay upon a straw
some fool would answer it.&nbsp; About ten days hence I expect a
letter from MD; N. 30.&mdash;You are now writing it, near the
end, as I guess.&mdash;I have not received DD&rsquo;s money; but
I will give you a note for it on Parvisol, and bed oo paadon <a
name="citation440d"></a><a href="#footnote440d"
class="citation">[440d]</a> I have not done it before.&nbsp; I am
just now thinking to go lodge at Kensington for the air.&nbsp;
Lady Masham has teased me to do it, but business has hindered me;
but now Lord Treasurer has removed thither.&nbsp; Fifteen of our
Society dined together under a canopy in an arbour at
Parson&rsquo;s Green <a name="citation440e"></a><a
href="#footnote440e" class="citation">[440e]</a> last Thursday: I
never saw anything so fine and romantic.&nbsp; We got a great
victory last Wednesday in the House of Lords by a majority, I
think, of twenty-eight; and the Whigs had desired their friends
to bespeak places to see Lord Treasurer carried to the Tower. <a

class="citation">[440f]</a>&nbsp; I met your Higgins <a
name="citation440g"></a><a href="#footnote440g"
class="citation">[440g]</a> here yesterday: he roars at the
insolence of the Whigs in Ireland, talks much of his own
sufferings and expenses in asserting the cause of the Church; and
I find he <a name="page441"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
441</span>would fain plead merit enough to desire that his
fortune should be mended.&nbsp; I believe he designs to make as
much noise as he can in order to preferment.&nbsp; Pray let the
Provost, when he sees you, give you ten English shillings, and I
will give as much here to the man who delivered me Rymer&rsquo;s
books: <a name="citation441a"></a><a href="#footnote441a"
class="citation">[441a]</a> he knows the meaning.&nbsp; Tell him
I will not trust him, but that you can order it to be paid me
here; and I will trust you till I see you.&nbsp; Have I told you
that the rogue Patrick has left me these two months, to my great
satisfaction?&nbsp; I have got another, who seems to be much
better, if he continues it.&nbsp; I am printing a threepenny
pamphlet, <a name="citation441b"></a><a href="#footnote441b"
class="citation">[441b]</a> and shall print another in a
fortnight, and then I have done, unless some new occasion
starts.&nbsp; Is my curate Warburton married to Mrs. Melthrop in

of Ormond producing letters in the council of war, with orders
not to fight, will surprise you in Ireland.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer
said in the House of Lords that in a few days the treaty of peace

hazard a battle, and sacrifice many lives in such a
juncture.&nbsp; If the peace holds, all will do well, otherwise I
know not how we shall weather it.&nbsp; And it was reckoned as a
wrong step in politics for Lord Treasurer to open himself so

<h3>LETTER XLVIII. <a name="citation442c"></a><a
href="#footnote442c" class="citation">[442c]</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Kensington</span>, <i>June</i> 17, 1712.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> been so tosticated about
since my last, that I could not go on in my journal manner,
though my shoulder is a great deal better; however, I feel
constant pain in it, but I think it diminishes, and I have cut
off some slices from my flannel.&nbsp; I have lodged here near a
fortnight, partly for the air and exercise, partly to be near the
Court, where dinners are to be found.&nbsp; I generally get a
lift in a coach to town, and in the evening I walk back.&nbsp; On
Saturday I dined with the Duchess of Ormond at her lodge near
Sheen, and thought to get a boat back as usual.&nbsp; I walked by
the bank to Cue [Kew], but no boat, then to Mortlake, but no
boat, and it was nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; At last a little
sculler called, full of nasty people.&nbsp; I made him set me
down at Hammersmith, so walked two miles to this place, and got
here by eleven.&nbsp; Last night I had another such
difficulty.&nbsp; I was in the City till past ten at night; it
rained hard, but no coach to be had.&nbsp; It gave over a little,
and I walked all the way here, and got home by twelve.&nbsp; I
love these shabby difficulties when they are over; but I hate
them, because they arise from not having a thousand pound a
year.&nbsp; I had your N. 30 <a name="page443"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 443</span>about three days ago, which I will
now answer.&nbsp; And first, I did not relapse, but found <a
name="citation443a"></a><a href="#footnote443a"
class="citation">[443a]</a> I came out before I ought; and so,
and so, as I have told you in some of my last.&nbsp; The first
coming abroad made people think I was quite recovered, and I had
no more messages afterwards.&nbsp; Well, but <i>John Bull</i> is
not writ by the person you imagine, as hope! <a
name="citation443b"></a><a href="#footnote443b"
class="citation">[443b]</a>&nbsp; It is too good for another to
own.&nbsp; Had it been Grub Street, I would have let people think
as they please; and I think that&rsquo;s right: is not it now? so
flap ee hand, and make wry mouth oo-self, sauci doxi.&nbsp; Now
comes DD.&nbsp; Why sollah, I did write in a fortnight my 47th;
and if it did not come in due time, can I help wind and weather?
am I a Laplander? am I a witch? can I work miracles? can I make
easterly winds?&nbsp; Now I am against Dr. Smith.&nbsp; I drink
little water with my wine, yet I believe he is right.&nbsp; Yet
Dr. Cockburn told me a little wine would not hurt me; but it is
so hot and dry, and water is so dangerous.&nbsp; The worst thing
here is my evenings at Lord Masham&rsquo;s, where Lord Treasurer
comes, and we sit till after twelve.&nbsp; But it is convenient I
should be among them for a while as much as possible.&nbsp; I
need not tell oo why.&nbsp; But I hope that will be at an end in
a month or two, one way or other, and I am resolved it
shall.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t go to Tunbridge, or anywhere else
out of the way, in this juncture.&nbsp; So Ppt designs for
Templeoag (what a name is that!).&nbsp; Whereabouts is that
place?&nbsp; I hope not very far from Dublin.&nbsp; Higgins is
here, roaring that all is wrong in Ireland, and would have me get
him an audience of Lord Treasurer to tell him so; but I will have
nothing to do in it, no, not I, faith.&nbsp; We have had no
thunder till last night, and till then we were dead for want of
rain; but there fell a great deal: no field looked green.&nbsp; I
reckon the Queen will go to Windsor in three or four weeks: and
if the Secretary takes a house there, I shall be sometimes with
him.&nbsp; But how affectedly Ppt talks of my being here all the
summer; which I do not intend: nor to stay one minute longer in
England than becomes the circumstances I am in.&nbsp; I wish <a
name="page444"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 444</span>you would
go soon into the country, and take a good deal of it; and where
better than Trim?&nbsp; Joe will be your humble servant, Parvisol
your slave, and Raymond at your command, for he piques himself on
good manners.&nbsp; I have seen Dilly&rsquo;s wife&mdash;and I
have seen once or twice old Bradley <a name="citation444a"></a><a
href="#footnote444a" class="citation">[444a]</a> here.&nbsp; He
is very well, very old, and very wise: I believe I must go see
his wife, when I have leisure.&nbsp; I should be glad to see
Goody Stoyte and her husband; pray give them my humble service,
and to Catherine, and to Mrs. Walls&mdash;I am not the least bit
in love with Mrs. Walls&mdash;I suppose the cares of the husband
increase with the fruitfulness of the wife.&nbsp; I am grad at
halt <a name="citation444b"></a><a href="#footnote444b"
class="citation">[444b]</a> to hear of Ppt&rsquo;s good health:
pray let her finish it by drinking waters.&nbsp; I hope DD had
her bill, and has her money.&nbsp; Remember to write a due time
before ME money is wanted, and be good galls, dood dallars, I
mean, and no crying dallars.&nbsp; I heard somebody coming
upstairs, and forgot I was in the country; and I was afraid of a
visitor: that is one advantage of being here, that I am not
teased with solicitors.&nbsp; Molt, the chemist, is my
acquaintance.&nbsp; My service to Dr. Smith.&nbsp; I sent the
question to him about Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s cordial, and the
answer he returned is in these words: &ldquo;It is directly after
Mr. Boyle&rsquo;s receipt.&rdquo;&nbsp; That commission is
performed; if he wants any of it, Molt shall use him
fairly.&nbsp; I suppose Smith is one of your physicians.&nbsp;
So, now your letter is fully and impartially answered; not as
rascals answer me: I believe, if I writ an essay upon a straw, I
should have a shoal of answerers: but no matter for that; you see
I can answer without making any reflections, as becomes men of
learning.&nbsp; Well, but now for the peace: why, we expect it
daily; but the French have the staff in their own hands, and we
trust to their honesty.&nbsp; I wish it were otherwise.&nbsp;
Things are now in the way of being soon in the extremes of well
or ill.&nbsp; I hope and believe the first.&nbsp; Lord Wharton is
gone out of town in a rage, and curses himself and friends for
ruining themselves in defending Lord Marlborough and Godolphin,
and taking Nottingham <a name="page445"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 445</span>into their favour.&nbsp; He swears
he will meddle no more during this reign; a pretty speech at
sixty-six, and the Queen is near twenty years younger, and now in
very good health; for you must know her health is fixed by a
certain reason, that she has done with braces (I must use the
expression), and nothing ill is happened to her since; so she has

<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Kensington</span>, <i>July</i> 1, 1712.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">never</span> was in a worse station for
writing letters than this, especially for writing to MD, since I
left off my journals.&nbsp; For I go to town early; and when I
come home at night, I generally go to Lord Masham, where Lord
Treasurer comes, and we stay till past twelve.&nbsp; But I am now
resolved to write journals again, though my shoulder is not yet
well; for I have still a few itching pimples, and a little pain
now and then.&nbsp; It is now high cherry-time with us; take
notice, is it so soon with you?&nbsp; And we have early apricots,
and gooseberries are ripe.&nbsp; On Sunday Archdeacon Parnell
came here to see me.&nbsp; It seems he has been ill for grief of
his wife&rsquo;s death, <a name="citation445d"></a><a
href="#footnote445d" class="citation">[445d]</a> and has been two
months at the Bath.&nbsp; He has a <a name="page446"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 446</span>mind to go to Dunkirk with Jack
Hill, <a name="citation446a"></a><a href="#footnote446a"
class="citation">[446a]</a> and I persuade him to it, and have
spoke to Hill to receive him; but I doubt he won&rsquo;t have
spirit to go.&nbsp; I have made Ford <a
name="citation446b"></a><a href="#footnote446b"
class="citation">[446b]</a> Gazetteer, and got two hundred pounds
a year settled on the employment by the Secretary of State,
beside the perquisites.&nbsp; It is the prettiest employment in
England of its bigness; yet the puppy does not seem satisfied
with it.&nbsp; I think people keep some follies to themselves,
till they have occasion to produce them.&nbsp; He thinks it not
genteel enough, and makes twenty difficulties.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
impossible to make any man easy.&nbsp; His salary is paid him
every week, if he pleases, without taxes or abatements.&nbsp; He
has little to do for it.&nbsp; He has a pretty office, with
coals, candles, papers, etc.; can frank what letters he will; and
his perquisites, if he takes care, may be worth one hundred
pounds more.&nbsp; I hear the Bishop of Clogher is landing, or
landed, in England; and I hope to see him in a few days.&nbsp; I
was to see Mrs. Bradley <a name="citation446c"></a><a
href="#footnote446c" class="citation">[446c]</a> on Sunday
night.&nbsp; Her youngest son is married to somebody worth
nothing, and her daughter was forced to leave Lady Giffard,
because she was striking up an intrigue with a footman, who
played well upon the flute.&nbsp; This is the mother&rsquo;s
account of it.&nbsp; Yesterday the old Bishop of Worcester, <a
name="citation446d"></a><a href="#footnote446d"
class="citation">[446d]</a> who pretends to be a prophet, went to
the Queen, by appointment, to prove to Her Majesty, out of Daniel
and the Revelations, that four years hence there would be a war
of religion; that the King of France would be a Protestant, and
fight on their side; that the Popedom would be destroyed, etc.;
and declared that he would be content to give up his bishopric if
it were not true.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer, who told it me, was by,
and some others; and I am told Lord Treasurer confounded him
sadly in his own learning, which made the old fool very
quarrelsome.&nbsp; He is near <a name="page447"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 447</span>ninety years old.&nbsp; Old Bradley
is fat and lusty, and has lost his palsy.&nbsp; Have you seen
<i>Toland&rsquo;s Invitation to Dismal</i>? <a
name="citation447a"></a><a href="#footnote447a"
class="citation">[447a]</a>&nbsp; How do you like it?&nbsp; But
it is an imitation of Horace, and perhaps you don&rsquo;t
understand Horace.&nbsp; Here has been a great sweep of
employments, and we expect still more removals.&nbsp; The Court
seems resolved to make thorough work.&nbsp; Mr. Hill intended to
set out to-morrow for Dunkirk, of which he is appointed Governor;
but he tells me to-day that he cannot go till Thursday or
Friday.&nbsp; I wish it were over.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary tells me
he is [in] no fear at all that France will play tricks with
us.&nbsp; If we have Dunkirk once, all is safe.&nbsp; We rail now
all against the Dutch, who, indeed, have acted like knaves,
fools, and madmen.&nbsp; Mr. Secretary is soon to be made a
viscount.&nbsp; He desired I would draw the preamble of his
patent; but I excused myself from a work that might lose me a
great deal of reputation, and get me very little.&nbsp; We would
fain have the Court make him an earl, but it would not be; and
therefore he will not take the title of Bullenbrook, <a
name="citation447b"></a><a href="#footnote447b"
class="citation">[447b]</a> which is lately extinct in the elder
branch of his family.&nbsp; I have advised him to be called Lord
Pomfret; but he thinks that title is already in some other
family; <a name="citation447c"></a><a href="#footnote447c"
class="citation">[447c]</a> and, besides, he objects that it is
in Yorkshire, where he has no estate; but there is nothing in
that, and I love Pomfret.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you love
Pomfret?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis in all our histories; they
are full of Pomfret Castle.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s all this to
you?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t care for this.&nbsp; Is Goody Stoyte
come to London?&nbsp; I have not heard of her yet.&nbsp; The Dean
of St. Patrick&rsquo;s never had the manners to answer my
letter.&nbsp; I was t&rsquo;other day to see Sterne <a
name="citation447d"></a><a href="#footnote447d"
class="citation">[447d]</a> and his wife.&nbsp; She is not half
so handsome as when I saw her with you at Dublin.&nbsp; <a
name="page448"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 448</span>They design
to pass the summer at a house near Lord Somers&rsquo;s, about a
dozen miles off.&nbsp; You never told me how my <i>Letter to Lord
Treasurer</i> passes in Ireland.&nbsp; I suppose you are drinking
at this time Temple-something&rsquo;s <a
name="citation448a"></a><a href="#footnote448a"
class="citation">[448a]</a> waters.&nbsp; Steele was arrested the
other day for making a lottery directly against an Act of
Parliament.&nbsp; He is now under prosecution; but they think it
will be dropped out of pity. <a name="citation448b"></a><a
href="#footnote448b" class="citation">[448b]</a>&nbsp; I believe
he will very soon lose his employment, for he has been mighty
impertinent of late in his <i>Spectators</i>; and I will never
offer a word in his behalf.&nbsp; Raymond writes me word that the
Bishop of Meath <a name="citation448c"></a><a
href="#footnote448c" class="citation">[448c]</a> was going to
summon me, in order to suspension, for absence, if the Provost
had not prevented him.&nbsp; I am prettily rewarded for getting
them their First-Fruits, with a p&mdash;.&nbsp; We have had very
little hot weather during the whole month of June; and for a week
past we have had a great deal of rain, though not every
day.&nbsp; I am just now told that the Governor of Dunkirk has
not orders yet to deliver up the town to Jack Hill and his
forces, but expects them daily.&nbsp; This must put off
Hill&rsquo;s journey a while, and I don&rsquo;t like these
stoppings in such an affair.&nbsp; Go, get oo gone, and drink oo
waters, if this rain has not spoiled them, sauci doxi.&nbsp; I
have no more to say to oo at plesent; but rove Pdfr, and MD, and
ME.&nbsp; And Podefr will rove Pdfr, and MD and ME.&nbsp; I wish
you had taken any account when I sent money to Mrs. Brent.&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Kensington</span>, <i>July</i> 17, 1712.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> weary of living in this place,
and glad to leave it soon.&nbsp; The Queen goes on Tuesday to
Windsor, and I shall follow in three or four days after.&nbsp; I
can do nothing here, going early to London, and coming late from
it, and supping at Lady Masham&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I dined to-day with
the Duke of Argyle at Cue [Kew], and would not go to the Court
to-night, because of writing to MD.&nbsp; The Bishop of Clogher
has been here this fortnight: I see him as often as I can.&nbsp;
Poor Master Ashe has a sad redness in his face; it is St.
Anthony&rsquo;s fire; his face all swelled, and will break in his
cheek, but no danger.&nbsp; Since Dunkirk has been in our hands,
Grub Street has been very fruitful.&nbsp; Pdfr has writ five or
six Grub Street papers this last week.&nbsp; Have you seen
<i>Toland&rsquo;s Invitation to Dismal</i>, <i>or Hue and Cry
after Dismal</i>, <i>or Ballad on Dunkirk</i>, <i>or Argument
that Dunkirk is not in our Hands</i>?&nbsp; Poh! you have seen
nothing.&nbsp; I am dead here with the hot weather; yet I walk
every night home, and believe it does me good: but my shoulder is
not yet right; itchings, and scratchings, and small
achings.&nbsp; Did I tell you I had made Ford Gazetteer, with two
hundred pounds a year salary, beside perquisites?&nbsp; I had a
letter lately from Parvisol, who says my canal looks very finely;
I long to see it; but no apples; all blasted again.&nbsp; He
tells me there will be a triennial visitation in August.&nbsp; I
must send Raymond another proxy.&nbsp; So now I will answer oo
rettle N. 33, <a name="citation449b"></a><a href="#footnote449b"
class="citation">[449b]</a> dated June 17.&nbsp; Ppt writes as
well as ever, for all her waters.&nbsp; I wish I had never come
here, as often and as heartily as Ppt.&nbsp; What had I to do
here?&nbsp; I have heard of the Bishop&rsquo;s making me uneasy,
but I did not think it was because I never writ to him.&nbsp; A
little would make me write to him, but I don&rsquo;t know what to
say.&nbsp; <a name="page450"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
450</span>I find I am obliged to the Provost for keeping the
Bishop <a name="citation450a"></a><a href="#footnote450a"
class="citation">[450a]</a> from being impertinent.&nbsp; Yes,
Maram DD, but oo would not be content with letters flom Pdfr of
six lines, or twelve either, fais.&nbsp; I hope Ppt will have
done with the waters soon, and find benefit by them.&nbsp; I
believe, if they were as far off as Wexford, they would do as
much good; for I take the journey to contribute as much as
anything.&nbsp; I can assure you the Bishop of Clogher&rsquo;s
being here does not in the least affect my staying or
going.&nbsp; I never talked to Higgins but once in my life in the
street, and I believe he and I shall hardly meet but by
chance.&nbsp; What care I whether my <i>Letter to Lord
Treasurer</i> be commended there or no?&nbsp; Why does not
somebody among you answer it, as three or four have done
here?&nbsp; (I am now sitting with nothing but my nightgown, for
heat.)&nbsp; Ppt shall have a great Bible.&nbsp; I have put it
down in my memlandums <a name="citation450b"></a><a
href="#footnote450b" class="citation">[450b]</a> just now.&nbsp;
And DD shall be repaid her t&rsquo;other book; but patience, all
in good time: you are so hasty, a dog would, etc.&nbsp; So Ppt
has neither won nor lost.&nbsp; Why, mun, I play sometimes too at
picket, that is picquet, I mean; but very seldom.&mdash;Out late?
why, &rsquo;tis only at Lady Masham&rsquo;s, and that is in our
town; but I never come late here from London, except once in
rain, when I could not get a coach.&nbsp; We have had very little
thunder here; none these two months.&nbsp; Why, pray, madam
philosopher, how did the rain hinder the thunder from doing any
harm?&nbsp; I suppose it ssquenched it.&nbsp; So here comes Ppt
aden <a name="citation450c"></a><a href="#footnote450c"

postscript.&nbsp; O Rold, dlunken srut! <a

else.&nbsp; You hear Secretary St. John is made Viscount
Bullinbrook. <a name="citation450f"></a><a href="#footnote450f"
class="citation">[450f]</a>&nbsp; I can hardly persuade him to
take that title, because the <a name="page451"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 451</span>eldest branch of his family had it
in an earldom, and it was last year extinct.&nbsp; If he did not
take it, I advised him to be Lord Pomfret, which I think is a
noble title.&nbsp; You hear of it often in the <i>Chronicles</i>,
Pomfret Castle: but we believed it was among the titles of some
other lord.&nbsp; Jack Hill sent his sister a pattern of a
head-dress from Dunkirk; it was like our fashion twenty years
ago, only not quite so high, and looked very ugly.&nbsp; I have
made Trapp <a name="citation451a"></a><a href="#footnote451a"
class="citation">[451a]</a> chaplain to Lord Bullinbroke, and he
is mighty happy and thankful for it.&nbsp; Mr. Addison returned
me my visit this morning.&nbsp; He lives in our town.&nbsp; I
shall be mighty retired, and mighty busy for a while at
Windsor.&nbsp; Pray why don&rsquo;t MD go to Trim, and see
Laracor, and give me an account of the garden, and the river, and
the holly and the cherry-trees on the river-walk?</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; I could not send this letter last post, being called
away before I could fold or finish it.&nbsp; I dined yesterday
with Lord Treasurer; sat with him till ten at night; yet could
not find a minute for some business I had with him.&nbsp; He
brought me to Kensington, and Lord Bulingbrook would not let me
go away till two; and I am now in bed, very lazy and sleepy at
nine.&nbsp; I must shave head and face, and meet Lord Bullinbrook
at eleven, and dine again with Lord Treasurer.&nbsp; To-day there

<h3>LETTER LI. <a name="citation452a"></a><a href="#footnote452a"
class="citation">[452a]</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Aug.</i> 7, 1712.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> your N. 32 at Windsor: I just
read it, and immediately sealed it up again, and shall read it no
more this twelvemonth at least.&nbsp; The reason of my resentment
at it is, because you talk as glibly of a thing as if it were
done, which, for aught I know, is farther from being done than
ever, since I hear not a word of it, though the town is full of
it, and the Court always giving me joy and vexation.&nbsp; You
might be sure I would have let you know as soon as it was done;
but I believe you fancied I would affect not to tell it you, but
let you learn it from newspapers and reports.&nbsp; I remember
only there was something in your letter about ME&rsquo;s money,
and that shall be taken care of on the other side.&nbsp; I left
Windsor on Monday last, upon Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s being gone
to France, and somebody&rsquo;s being here that I ought often to
consult with in an affair I am upon: but that person talks of
returning to Windsor again, and I believe I shall follow
him.&nbsp; I am now in a hedge-lodging very busy, as I am every
day till noon: so that this letter is like to be short, and you
are not to blame me these two months; for I protest, if I study
ever so hard, I cannot in that time compass what I am upon.&nbsp;
We have a fever both here and at Windsor, which hardly anybody
misses; but it lasts not above three or four days, and kills
nobody. <a name="citation452b"></a><a href="#footnote452b"
class="citation">[452b]</a>&nbsp; The Queen has forty servants
down of it at once.&nbsp; I dined yesterday with Treasurer, but
could do no business, though he sent for me, I thought, on
purpose; but he desires I will dine with him again to-day.&nbsp;
Windsor is a most delightful place, and at this time abounds in
dinners.&nbsp; My lodgings there <a name="page453"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 453</span>look upon Eton and the Thames.&nbsp;
I wish I was owner of them; they belong to a prebend.&nbsp; God
knows what was in your letter; and if it be not answered, whose
fault is it, sauci dallars?&mdash;Do you know that Grub Street is
dead and gone last week?&nbsp; No more ghosts or murders now for
love or money.&nbsp; I plied it pretty close the last fortnight,
and published at least seven penny papers of my own, besides some
of other people&rsquo;s: but now every single half-sheet pays a
halfpenny to the Queen. <a name="citation453a"></a><a
href="#footnote453a" class="citation">[453a]</a>&nbsp; The
<i>Observator</i> is fallen; the <i>Medleys</i> are jumbled
together with the <i>Flying Post</i>; the <i>Examiner</i> is
deadly sick; the <i>Spectator</i> keeps up, and doubles its
price; I know not how long it will hold.&nbsp; Have you seen the
red stamp the papers are marked with?&nbsp; Methinks it is worth
a halfpenny, the stamping it.&nbsp; Lord Bolingbroke and Prior
set out for France last Saturday.&nbsp; My lord&rsquo;s business
is to hasten the peace before the Dutch are too much mauled, and
hinder France from carrying the jest of beating them too
far.&nbsp; Have you seen the Fourth Part of <i>John Bull</i>? <a

extremely good.&nbsp; The Bishop of Clogher&rsquo;s son has been
ill of St. Anthony&rsquo;s fire, but is now quite well.&nbsp; I
was afraid his face would be spoiled, but it is not.&nbsp; Dilly
is just as he used to be, and puns as plentifully and as
bad.&nbsp; The two brothers see one another; but I think not the
two sisters.&nbsp; Raymond writ to me that he intended to invite
you to Trim.&nbsp; Are you, have you, will you be there?&nbsp;

to my being tosticated between this and Windsor.&nbsp; And pray
send me again the state of ME&rsquo;s money; for I will not look
into your letter for it.&nbsp; Poor Lord Winchelsea <a

title being fallen to her husband, but without much estate.&nbsp;
I have been poring my eyes all this morning, and it is now past
two afternoon, so I shall take a little walk in the Park.&nbsp;
Do you play at ombre still?&nbsp; Or is that off by Mr.

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Windsor</span>,
<i>Sept.</i> 15, 1712.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">never</span> was so long without writing
to MD as now, since I left them, nor ever will again while I am
able to write.&nbsp; I have expected from one week to another
that something would be done in my own affairs; but nothing at
all is, nor I don&rsquo;t know when anything will, or whether
ever at all, so slow are people at doing favours.&nbsp; I have
been much out of order of late with the old giddiness in my
head.&nbsp; I took a vomit for it two days ago, and will take
another about a day or two hence.&nbsp; I have eat mighty little
fruit; yet I impute my disorder to that little, and shall
henceforth wholly forbear it.&nbsp; I am engaged in a long work,
and have done all I can of it, and wait for some papers from the
Ministry for <a name="page455"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
455</span>materials for the rest; and they delay me, as if it
were a favour I asked of them; so that I have been idle here this
good while, and it happened in a right time, when I was too much
out of order to study.&nbsp; One is kept constantly out of humour
by a thousand unaccountable things in public proceedings; and
when I reason with some friends, we cannot conceive how affairs
can last as they are.&nbsp; God only knows, but it is a very
melancholy subject for those who have any near concern in
it.&nbsp; I am again endeavouring, as I was last year, to keep
people <a name="citation455a"></a><a href="#footnote455a"
class="citation">[455a]</a> from breaking to pieces upon a
hundred misunderstandings.&nbsp; One cannot withhold them from
drawing different ways, while the enemy is watching to destroy
both.&nbsp; See how my style is altered, by living and thinking
and talking among these people, instead of my canal and
river-walk and willows.&nbsp; I lose all my money here among the
ladies; <a name="citation455b"></a><a href="#footnote455b"
class="citation">[455b]</a> so that I never play when I can help
it, being sure to lose.&nbsp; I have lost five pounds the five
weeks I have been here.&nbsp; I hope Ppt is luckier at picquet
with the Dean and Mrs. Walls.&nbsp; The Dean never answered my
letter, though.&nbsp; I have clearly forgot whether I sent a bill
for ME in any of my last letters.&nbsp; I think I did; pray let
me know, and always give me timely notice.&nbsp; I wait here but
to see what they will do for me; and whenever preferments are
given from me, as hope saved, I will come over.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; I have taken a vomit to-day, and hope I shall be
better.&nbsp; I have been very giddy since I writ what is before,
yet not as I used to be: more frequent, but not so violent.&nbsp;
Yesterday we were alarmed with the Queen&rsquo;s being ill: she
had an aguish and feverish fit; and you never saw such
countenances as we all had, such dismal melancholy.&nbsp; Her
physicians from town were sent for, but towards night she grew
better; to-day she missed her fit, and was up: we are not now in
any fear; it will be at worst but an ague, and we hope even that
will not return.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer would not come here from
London, because it would make a noise if he came before his usual
time, which is Saturday, and he <a name="page456"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 456</span>goes away on Mondays.&nbsp; The
Whigs have lost a great support in the Earl of Godolphin. <a
name="citation456a"></a><a href="#footnote456a"
class="citation">[456a]</a>&nbsp; It is a good jest to hear the
Ministers talk of him now with humanity and pity, because he is
dead, and can do them no more hurt.&nbsp; Lady Orkney, <a
name="citation456b"></a><a href="#footnote456b"
class="citation">[456b]</a> the late King&rsquo;s mistress (who
lives at a fine place, five miles from hence, called Cliffden <a
name="citation456c"></a><a href="#footnote456c"
class="citation">[456c]</a>), and I, are grown mighty
acquaintance.&nbsp; She is the wisest woman I ever saw; and Lord
Treasurer made great use of her advice in the late change of
affairs.&nbsp; I heard Lord Marlborough is growing ill of his
diabetes; which, if it be true, may soon carry him off; and then
the Ministry will be something more at ease.&nbsp; MD has been a
long time without writing to Pdfr, though they have not the same
cause: it is seven weeks since your last came to my hands, which
was N. 32, that you may not be mistaken.&nbsp; I hope Ppt has not
wanted her health.&nbsp; You were then drinking waters.&nbsp; The
doctor tells me I must go into a course of steel, though I have
not the spleen; for that they can never give me, though I have as
much provocation to it as any man alive.&nbsp; Bernage&rsquo;s <a

class="citation">[456d]</a> regiment is broke; but he is upon
half-pay.&nbsp; I have not seen him this long time; but I suppose
he is overrun with melancholy.&nbsp; My Lord Shrewsbury is
certainly designed to be Governor of Ireland; and I believe the
Duchess will please the people there mightily.&nbsp; The Irish
Whig leaders promise great things to themselves from his
government; but care shall be taken, if possible, to prevent
them.&nbsp; Mrs. Fenton <a name="citation456e"></a><a

<a name="page457"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 457</span>that she
has been forced to leave Lady Giffard, and come to town, for a
rheumatism: that lady does not love to be troubled with sick
people.&nbsp; Mrs. Fenton writes to me as one dying, and desires
I would think of her son: I have not answered her letter.&nbsp;
She is retired <a name="citation457a"></a><a href="#footnote457a"
class="citation">[457a]</a> to Mrs. Povey&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Is my
aunt alive yet? and do you ever see her?&nbsp; I suppose she has
forgot the loss of her son.&nbsp; Is Raymond&rsquo;s new house
quite finished? and does he squander as he used to do?&nbsp; Has
he yet spent all his wife&rsquo;s fortune?&nbsp; I hear there are
five or six people putting strongly in for my livings; God help
them!&nbsp; But if ever the Court should give me anything, I
would recommend Raymond to the Duke of Ormond; not for any
particular friendship to him, but because it would be proper for
the minister of Trim to have Laracor.&nbsp; You may keep the
gold-studded snuff-box now; for my brother Hill, Governor of
Dunkirk, has sent me the finest that ever you saw. <a
name="citation457b"></a><a href="#footnote457b"
class="citation">[457b]</a>&nbsp; It is allowed at Court that
none in England comes near it, though it did not cost above
twenty pounds.&nbsp; And the Duchess of Hamilton has made me
pockets for [it] like a woman&rsquo;s, with a belt and buckle
(for, you know, I wear no waistcoat in summer), and there are
several divisions, and one on purpose for my box, oh ho!&mdash;We
have had most delightful weather this whole week; but illness and
vomiting have hindered me from sharing in a great part of
it.&nbsp; Lady Masham made the Queen send to Kensington for some
of her preserved ginger for me, which I take in the morning, and
hope it will do me good.&nbsp; Mrs. Brent <a
name="citation457c"></a><a href="#footnote457c"
class="citation">[457c]</a> sent me a letter by a young fellow, a
printer, desiring I would recommend him here, which you may tell
her I have done: but I cannot promise what will come of it, for
it is necessary they should be made free here <a
name="citation457d"></a><a href="#footnote457d"
class="citation">[457d]</a> before they can be employed.&nbsp; I
remember I put the boy prentice to Brent.&nbsp; I hope Parvisol
has set my tithes well this year: he has writ nothing to me about
it; pray talk to him of it when you see him, and let him give me
an account <a name="page458"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
458</span>how things are.&nbsp; I suppose the corn is now off the
ground.&nbsp; I hope he has sold that great ugly horse.&nbsp; Why
don&rsquo;t you sell to him?&nbsp; He keeps me at charges for
horses that I never ride: yours is lame, and will never be good
for anything.&nbsp; The Queen will stay here about a month
longer, I suppose; but Lady Masham will go in ten days to lie in
at Kensington.&nbsp; Poor creature, she fell down in the court
here t&rsquo;other day.&nbsp; She would needs walk across it upon
some displeasure with her chairmen, and was likely to be spoiled
so near her time; but we hope all is over for a black eye and a
sore side: though I shall not be at ease till she is brought to
bed.&nbsp; I find I can fill up a letter, some way or other,
without a journal.&nbsp; If I had not a spirit naturally
cheerful, I should be very much discontented at a thousand
things.&nbsp; Pray God preserve MD&rsquo;s health, and
Pdfr&rsquo;s, and that I may live far from the envy and
discontent that attends those who are thought to have more favour
at Courts than they really possess.&nbsp; Love Pdfr, who loves MD
above all things.&nbsp; Farewell, deelest, ten thousand times

<h3>LETTER LIII. <a name="citation458"></a><a href="#footnote458"
class="citation">[458]</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Oct.</i> 9, 1712.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> left Windsor these ten days,
and am deep in pills with asafoetida, and a steel bitter drink;
and I find my head much better than it was.&nbsp; I was very much
discouraged; for I used to be ill for three or four days
together, ready to totter as I walked.&nbsp; I take eight pills a
day, and have taken, I believe, a hundred and fifty
already.&nbsp; The Queen, Lord Treasurer, Lady Masham, and I,
were all ill together, but are now all better; only Lady Masham
expects every day to lie in at Kensington.&nbsp; There was never
such a lump of lies spread about the town together as now.&nbsp;
I doubt not but <a name="page459"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
459</span>you will have them in Dublin before this comes to you,
and all without the least grounds of truth.&nbsp; I have been
mightily put backward in something I am writing by my illness,
but hope to fetch it up, so as to be ready when the Parliament
meets.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer has had an ugly fit of the
rheumatism, but is now near quite well.&nbsp; I was playing at
one-and-thirty with him and his family t&rsquo;other night.&nbsp;
He gave us all twelvepence apiece to begin with: it put me in
mind of Sir William Temple. <a name="citation459a"></a><a
href="#footnote459a" class="citation">[459a]</a>&nbsp; I asked
both him and Lady Masham seriously whether the Queen were at all
inclined to a dropsy, and they positively assured me she was not:
so did her physician Arbuthnot, who always attends her.&nbsp; Yet
these devils have spread that she has holes in her legs, and runs
at her navel, and I know not what.&nbsp; Arbuthnot has sent me
from Windsor a pretty Discourse upon Lying, and I have ordered
the printer to come for it.&nbsp; It is a proposal for publishing
a curious piece, called <i>The Art of Political Lying</i>, in two
volumes, etc.&nbsp; And then there is an abstract of the first
volume, just like those pamphlets which they call <i>The Works of
the Learned</i>. <a name="citation459b"></a><a
href="#footnote459b" class="citation">[459b]</a>&nbsp; Pray get
it when it comes out.&nbsp; The Queen has a little of the gout in
one of her hands.&nbsp; I believe she will stay a month still at
Windsor.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer showed me the kindest letter from
her in the world, by which I picked out one secret, that there
will be soon made some Knights of the Garter.&nbsp; You know
another is fallen by Lord Godolphin&rsquo;s death: he will be
buried in a day or two at Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; I saw Tom
Leigh <a name="citation459c"></a><a href="#footnote459c"
class="citation">[459c]</a> in town once.&nbsp; The Bishop of
Clogher has taken his lodging for the winter; they are all
well.&nbsp; I hear there are in town abundance of people from
Ireland; half a dozen bishops at least. The poor old Bishop of
London, <a name="citation459d"></a><a href="#footnote459d"
class="citation">[459d]</a> at past fourscore, fell down backward
going upstairs, and I think broke or cracked his skull; yet is <a
name="page460"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 460</span>now
recovering.&nbsp; The town is as empty as at midsummer; and if I
had not occasion for physic, I would be at Windsor still.&nbsp;
Did I tell you of Lord Rivers&rsquo;s will?&nbsp; He has left
legacies to about twenty paltry old whores by name, and not a
farthing to any friend, dependent, or relation: he has left from
his only child, Lady Barrymore, <a name="citation460a"></a><a
href="#footnote460a" class="citation">[460a]</a> her
mother&rsquo;s estate, and given the whole to his heir-male, a
popish priest, a second cousin, who is now Earl Rivers, and whom
he used in his life like a footman.&nbsp; After him it goes to
his chief wench and bastard.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer and Lord
Chamberlain are executors of this hopeful will.&nbsp; I loved the
man, and detest his memory.&nbsp; We hear nothing of peace yet: I
believe verily the Dutch are so wilful, because they are told the
Queen cannot live.&nbsp; I had poor MD&rsquo;s letter, N. 3, <a
name="citation460b"></a><a href="#footnote460b"
class="citation">[460b]</a> at Windsor: but I could not answer it
then; poor Pdfr was vely kick <a name="citation460c"></a><a
href="#footnote460c" class="citation">[460c]</a> then: and,
besides, it was a very inconvenient place to send letters
from.&nbsp; Oo thought to come home the same day, and stayed a
month: that was a sign the place was agreeable. <a
name="citation460d"></a><a href="#footnote460d"
class="citation">[460d]</a>&nbsp; I should love such a sort of
jaunt.&nbsp; Is that lad Swanton <a name="citation460e"></a><a
href="#footnote460e" class="citation">[460e]</a> a little more
fixed than he used to be?&nbsp; I think you like the girl very
well.&nbsp; She has left off her grave airs, I suppose.&nbsp; I
am now told Lord Godolphin was buried last night.&mdash;O poo
Ppt! lay down oo head aden, fais I . . . ; I always reckon if oo
are ill I shall hear it, and therefore hen oo are silent I reckon
all is well. <a name="citation460f"></a><a href="#footnote460f"
class="citation">[460f]</a>&nbsp; I believe I &rsquo;scaped the
new fever <a name="citation460g"></a><a href="#footnote460g"
class="citation">[460g]</a> for the same reason that Ppt did,
because I am not well; but why should DD &rsquo;scape it,
pray?&nbsp; She is <a name="page461"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
461</span>melthigal, oo know, and ought to have the fever; but I
hope it is now too late, and she won&rsquo;t have it at
all.&nbsp; Some physicians here talk very melancholy, and think
it foreruns the plague, which is actually at Hamburg.&nbsp; I
hoped Ppt would have done with her illness; but I think we both
have that faculty never to part with a disorder for ever; we are
very constant.&nbsp; I have had my giddiness twenty-three years
by fits.&nbsp; Will Mrs. Raymond never have done lying-in?&nbsp;
He intends to leave beggars enough; for I daresay he has
squandered away the best part of his fortune already, and is not
out of debt.&nbsp; I had a letter from him lately.</p>
<p>Oct. 11.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer sent for me yesterday and the
day before to sit with him, because he is not yet quite well
enough to go abroad; and I could not finish my letter.&nbsp; How
the deuce come I to be so exact in ME money?&nbsp; Just seventeen
shillings and eightpence more than due; I believe you cheat
me.&nbsp; If Hawkshaw does not pay the interest I will have the
principal; pray speak to Parvisol and have his advice what I
should do about it.&nbsp; Service to Mrs. Stoyte and Catherine
and Mrs. Walls.&nbsp; Ppt makes a petition with many
apologies.&nbsp; John Danvers, you know, is Lady Giffard&rsquo;s
friend.&nbsp; The rest I never heard of.&nbsp; I tell you what,
as things are at present, I cannot possibly speak to Lord
Treasurer for anybody.&nbsp; I need tell you no more.&nbsp;
Something or nothing will be done in my own affairs: if the
former, I will be a solicitor for your sister; <a
name="citation461a"></a><a href="#footnote461a"
class="citation">[461a]</a> if the latter, I have done with
Courts for ever.&nbsp; Opportunities will often fall in my way,
if I am used well, and I will then make it my business.&nbsp; It
is my delight to do good offices for people who want and deserve,
and a tenfold delight to do it to a relation of Ppt, whose
affairs she has so at heart. <a name="citation461b"></a><a
href="#footnote461b" class="citation">[461b]</a>&nbsp; I have
taken down his name and his case (not <i>her</i> case), and
whenever a proper time comes, I will do all I can; zat&rsquo;s

Patrick at denying me.&nbsp; Patrick has been soliciting to come

href="#footnote463a" class="citation">[463a]</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Oct.</i> 28, 1712.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> been in physic this month,
and have been better these three weeks.&nbsp; I stop my physic,
by the doctor&rsquo;s orders, till he sends me further
directions.&nbsp; DD grows politician, and longs to hear the
peace is proclaimed.&nbsp; I hope we shall have it soon, for the
Dutch are fully humbled; and Prior is just come over from France
for a few days; I suppose upon some important affair.&nbsp; I saw
him last night, but had no private talk with him.&nbsp; Stocks
rise upon his coming.&nbsp; As for my stay in England, it cannot
be long now, so tell my friends.&nbsp; The Parliament will not
meet till after Christmas, and by that time the work I am doing
will be over, and then nothing shall keep me.&nbsp; I am very
much discontented at Parvisol, about neglecting to sell my
horses, etc.</p>
<p>Lady Masham is not yet brought to bed; but we expect it
daily.&nbsp; I dined with her to-day.&nbsp; Lord Bolingbroke
returned about two months ago, and Prior about a week; and goes
back (Prior I mean) in a few days.&nbsp; Who told you of my
snuff-box and pocket?&nbsp; Did I?&nbsp; I had a letter to-day
from Dr. Coghill, <a name="citation463b"></a><a
href="#footnote463b" class="citation">[463b]</a> desiring me to
get Raphoe for Dean Sterne, and the deanery for myself.&nbsp; I
shall indeed, I have such obligations to Sterne.&nbsp; But
however, if I am asked who will make a good bishop, I shall name
him before anybody.&nbsp; Then comes another letter, desiring I
would recommend a Provost, <a name="citation463c"></a><a
href="#footnote463c" class="citation">[463c]</a> supposing that
Pratt (who has been here about a week) will certainly be
promoted; but I believe he will not.&nbsp; I presented Pratt to
Lord Treasurer, and truly young Molyneux <a
name="citation463d"></a><a href="#footnote463d"
class="citation">[463d]</a> would have had me present him too;
but I directly <a name="page464"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
464</span>answered him I would not, unless he had business with
him.&nbsp; He is the son of one Mr. Molyneux of Ireland.&nbsp;
His father wrote a book; <a name="citation464a"></a><a
href="#footnote464a" class="citation">[464a]</a> I suppose you
know it.&nbsp; Here is the Duke of Marlborough going out of
England (Lord knows why), which causes many speculations.&nbsp;
Some say he is conscious of guilt, and dare not stand it.&nbsp;
Others think he has a mind to fling an odium on the Government,
as who should say that one who has done such great services to
his country cannot live quietly in it, by reason of the malice of
his enemies.&nbsp; I have helped to patch up these people <a
name="citation464b"></a><a href="#footnote464b"
class="citation">[464b]</a> together once more.&nbsp; God knows
how long it may last. I was to-day at a trial between Lord
Lansdowne and Lord Carteret, two friends of mine.&nbsp; It was in
the Queen&rsquo;s Bench, for about six thousand a year (or nine,
I think).&nbsp; I sat under Lord Chief-Justice Parker, and his
pen falling down I reached it up.&nbsp; He made me a low bow; and
I was going to whisper him that <i>I had done good for evil</i>;
<i>for he would have taken mine from me</i>. <a
name="citation464c"></a><a href="#footnote464c"
class="citation">[464c]</a>&nbsp; I told it Lord Treasurer and
Bolingbroke.&nbsp; Parker would not have known me, if several
lords on the bench, and in the court, bowing, had not turned
everybody&rsquo;s eyes, and set them a whispering.&nbsp; I owe
the dog a spite, and will pay him in two months at furthest, if I
can.&nbsp; So much for that.&nbsp; But you must have chat, and I
must say every sorry thing that comes into my head.&nbsp; They
say the Queen will stay a month longer at Windsor.&nbsp; These
devils of Grub Street rogues, that write the <i>Flying Post</i>
and <i>Medley</i> in one paper, <a name="citation464d"></a><a
href="#footnote464d" class="citation">[464d]</a> will not be
quiet.&nbsp; They are always mauling Lord Treasurer, Lord
Bolingbroke, and me.&nbsp; We have the dog under prosecution, but
Bolingbroke is not active enough; but I hope to swinge him.&nbsp;
He is a Scotch rogue, one Ridpath. <a name="citation464e"></a><a
href="#footnote464e" class="citation">[464e]</a>&nbsp; They get
<a name="page465"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 465</span>out upon
bail, and write on.&nbsp; We take them again, and get fresh bail;
so it goes round.&nbsp; They say some learned Dutchman has wrote
a book, proving by civil law that we do them wrong by this peace;
but I shall show by plain reason that we have suffered the wrong,
and not they.&nbsp; I toil like a horse, and have hundreds of
letters still to read and squeeze a line out of each, or at least
the seeds of a line.&nbsp; Strafford goes back to Holland in a
day or two, and I hope our peace is very near.&nbsp; I have about
thirty pages more to write (that is, to be extracted), which will
be sixty in print.&nbsp; It is the most troublesome part of all,
and I cannot keep myself private, though I stole into a room up
two pair of stairs, when I came from Windsor; but my present man
has not yet learned his lesson of denying me discreetly.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; The Duchess of Ormond found me out to-day, and made
me dine with her.&nbsp; Lady Masham is still expecting.&nbsp; She
has had a cruel cold.&nbsp; I could not finish my letter last
post for the soul of me.&nbsp; Lord Bolingbroke has had my papers
these six weeks, and done nothing to them.&nbsp; Is Tisdall yet
in the world?&nbsp; I propose writing controversies, to get a
name with posterity.&nbsp; The Duke of Ormond will not be over
these three or four days.&nbsp; I desire to make him join with me
in settling all right among our people.&nbsp; I have ordered the
Duchess to let me have an hour with the Duke at his first coming,
to give him a true state of persons and things.&nbsp; I believe
the Duke of Shrewsbury will hardly be declared your Governor yet;
at least, I think so now; but resolutions alter very often.&nbsp;
The Duke of Hamilton gave me a pound of snuff to-day, admirable
good.&nbsp; I wish DD had it, and Ppt too, if she likes it.&nbsp;
It cost me a quarter of an hour <a name="page466"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 466</span>of his politics, which I was forced
to hear.&nbsp; Lady Orkney <a name="citation466a"></a><a
href="#footnote466a" class="citation">[466a]</a> is making me a
writing-table of her own contrivance, and a bed nightgown.&nbsp;
She is perfectly kind, like a mother.&nbsp; I think the devil was
in it the other day, that I should talk to her of an ugly
squinting cousin of hers, and the poor lady herself, you know,
squints like a dragon.&nbsp; The other day we had a long
discourse with her about love; and she told us a saying of her
sister Fitz-Hardinge, <a name="citation466b"></a><a
href="#footnote466b" class="citation">[466b]</a> which I thought
excellent, that in men, desire begets love, and in women, love
begets desire.&nbsp; We have abundance of our old criers <a
name="citation466c"></a><a href="#footnote466c"
class="citation">[466c]</a> still hereabouts.&nbsp; I hear every
morning your women with the old satin and taffeta, etc., the
fellow with old coats, suits or cloaks.&nbsp; Our weather is
abominable of late.&nbsp; We have not two tolerable days in
twenty.&nbsp; I have lost money again at ombre, with Lord Orkney
and others; yet, after all, this year I have lost but
three-and-twenty shillings; so that, considering card money, I am
no loser.</p>
<p>Our Society hath not yet renewed their meetings.&nbsp; I hope
we shall continue to do some good this winter; and Lord Treasurer
promises the Academy for reforming our language shall soon go
forward.&nbsp; I must now go hunt those dry letter for
materials.&nbsp; You will see something very notable, I
hope.&nbsp; So much for that.&nbsp; God Almighty bless you.</p>
<h3>LETTER LV. <a name="citation466d"></a><a href="#footnote466d"
class="citation">[466d]</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Nov.</i> 15, 1712.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> this comes to your hands,
you will have heard of the most terrible accident that hath
almost ever happened.&nbsp; This morning, at eight, my man
brought me word that the Duke of Hamilton had fought with Lord <a
name="page467"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 467</span>Mohun, <a
name="citation467a"></a><a href="#footnote467a"
class="citation">[467a]</a> and killed him, and was brought home
wounded. <a name="citation467b"></a><a href="#footnote467b"
class="citation">[467b]</a>&nbsp; I immediately sent him to the
Duke&rsquo;s house, in St. James&rsquo;s Square; but the porter
could hardly answer for tears, and a great rabble was about the
house.&nbsp; In short, they fought at seven this morning.&nbsp;
The dog Mohun was killed on the spot; and while <a
name="citation467c"></a><a href="#footnote467c"
class="citation">[467c]</a> the Duke was over him, Mohun,
shortening his sword, stabbed him in at the shoulder to the
heart.&nbsp; The Duke was helped toward the cake-house by the
Ring in Hyde Park (where they fought), and died on the grass,
before he could reach the house; and was brought home in his
coach by eight, while the poor Duchess <a
name="citation467d"></a><a href="#footnote467d"
class="citation">[467d]</a> was asleep.&nbsp; Maccartney, <a
name="citation467e"></a><a href="#footnote467e"
class="citation">[467e]</a> and one Hamilton, <a
name="citation467f"></a><a href="#footnote467f"
class="citation">[467f]</a> were the seconds, who fought
likewise, and are both fled.&nbsp; I am told that a footman of
Lord Mohun&rsquo;s stabbed the Duke of Hamilton; and some say
Maccartney did so too.&nbsp; Mohun gave the affront, and yet sent
the challenge.&nbsp; I am infinitely concerned for the poor Duke,
who was a frank, honest, good-natured man.&nbsp; I loved him very
well, and I think he loved me better.&nbsp; He had <a
name="citation467g"></a><a href="#footnote467g"
class="citation">[467g]</a> the greatest mind in the world to
have me go with him to France, but durst not tell it me; and
those he did, said I could not be spared, <a
name="page468"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 468</span>which was
true.&nbsp; They have removed the poor Duchess to a lodging in
the neighbourhood, where I have been with her two hours, and am
just come away.&nbsp; I never saw so melancholy a scene; for
indeed all reasons for real grief belong to her; nor is it
possible for anybody to be a greater loser in all regards.&nbsp;
She has moved my very soul.&nbsp; The lodging was inconvenient,
and they would have removed her to another; but I would not
suffer it, because it had no room backward, and she must have
been tortured with the noise of the Grub Street screamers
mention[ing] her husband&rsquo;s murder to her ears.</p>
<p>I believe you have heard the story of my escape, in opening
the bandbox sent to Lord Treasurer. <a name="citation468a"></a><a
href="#footnote468a" class="citation">[468a]</a>&nbsp; The prints
have told a thousand lies of it; but at last we gave them a true
account of it at length, printed in the evening; <a
name="citation468b"></a><a href="#footnote468b"
class="citation">[468b]</a> only I would not suffer them to name
me, having been so often named before, and teased to death with
questions.&nbsp; I wonder how I came to have so much presence of
mind, which is usually not my talent; but so it pleased God, and
I saved myself and him; for there was a bullet apiece.&nbsp; A
gentleman told me that if I had been killed, the Whigs would have
called it a judgment, because the barrels were of inkhorns, with

<p>16.&nbsp; I thought to have finished this yesterday; but was
too much disturbed.&nbsp; I sent a letter early this morning to
Lady Masham, to beg her to write some comforting words to the
poor Duchess.&nbsp; I dined to-[day] with Lady Masham at
Kensington, where she is expecting these two months to lie
in.&nbsp; She has promised me to get the Queen to write to the
Duchess kindly on this occasion; and to-morrow I will beg Lord
Treasurer to visit and comfort her.&nbsp; I have been with her
two hours again, and find her worse: her violences not so
frequent, but her melancholy more formal and settled.&nbsp; She
has abundance of wit and spirit; about thirty-three years old;
handsome and airy, and seldom spared anybody that gave her the
least provocation; by which she had many enemies and few
friends.&nbsp; Lady Orkney, her sister-in-law, is come to town on
this occasion, and has been to see her, and behaved herself with
great humanity.&nbsp; They have been always very ill together,
and the poor Duchess could not have patience when people told her
I went often to Lady Orkney&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But I am resolved to
make them friends; for the Duchess is now no more the object of
envy, and must learn humility from the severest master,
Affliction.&nbsp; I design to make the Ministry put out a
proclamation (if it can be found proper) against that villain
Maccartney.&nbsp; What shall we do with these murderers?&nbsp; I
cannot end this letter to-night, and there is no occasion; for I
cannot send it till Tuesday, and the crowner&rsquo;s inquest on
the Duke&rsquo;s body is to be to-morrow, and I shall know
more.&nbsp; But what care oo for all this?&nbsp; Iss, poo MD im
sorry for poo Pdfr&rsquo;s <a name="citation469b"></a><a
href="#footnote469b" class="citation">[469b]</a> friends; and
this is a very surprising event.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis late, and
I&rsquo;ll go to bed.&nbsp; This looks like journals.&nbsp;
Nite.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; I was to-day at noon with the Duchess of Hamilton
again, after I had been with Lady Orkney, and charged her <a
name="page470"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 470</span>to be kind
to her sister in her affliction.&nbsp; The Duchess told me Lady
Orkney had been with her, and that she did not treat her as
gently as she ought.&nbsp; They hate one another, but I will try
to patch it up.&nbsp; I have been drawing up a paragraph for the
<i>Postboy</i>, to be out to-morrow, and as malicious as
possible, and very proper for Abel Roper, <a
name="citation470a"></a><a href="#footnote470a"
class="citation">[470a]</a> the printer of it.&nbsp; I dined at
Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s at six in the evening, which is his usual
hour of returning from Windsor: he promises to visit the Duchess
to-morrow, and says he has a message to her from the Queen.&nbsp;
Thank God.&nbsp; I have stayed till past one with him.&nbsp; So
nite deelest MD. <a name="citation470b"></a><a
href="#footnote470b" class="citation">[470b]</a></p>
<p>18.&nbsp; The Committee of Council is to sit this afternoon
upon the affair of the Duke of Hamilton&rsquo;s murder, and I
hope a proclamation will be out against Maccartney.&nbsp; I was
just now (&rsquo;tis now noon) with the Duchess, to let her know
Lord Treasurer will see her.&nbsp; She is mightily out of
order.&nbsp; The jury have not yet brought in their verdict upon
the crowner&rsquo;s inquest. We suspect Maccartney stabbed the
Duke while he was fighting.&nbsp; The Queen and Lord Treasurer
are in great concern at this event.&nbsp; I dine to-day again
with Lord Treasurer; but must send this to the post-office
before, because else I shall not have time; he usually keeping me
so late.&nbsp; Ben Tooke bid me write to DD to send her
certificate, for it is high time it should be sent, he
says.&nbsp; Pray make Parvisol write to me, and send me a general
account of my affairs; and let him know I shall be over in
spring, and that by all means he sells the horses.&nbsp; Prior
has kissed the Queen&rsquo;s hand, and will return to France in a
few days, and Lord Strafford to Holland; and now the King of
Spain has renounced his pretensions to France, the peace must
follow very soon unavoidably.&nbsp; You must no more call Philip,
Duke of Anjou, for we now acknowledge him King of Spain.&nbsp;
Dr. Pratt tells me you are all mad in Ireland with your playhouse
frolics and prologues, and I know not what.&nbsp; The Bishop of
<a name="page471"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 471</span>Clogher
and family are well: they have heard from you, or you from them,
lately, I have forgot which: I dined there t&rsquo;other day, but
the Bishop came not till after dinner; and our meat and drink was
very so so.&nbsp; Mr. Vedeau <a name="citation471a"></a><a
href="#footnote471a" class="citation">[471a]</a> was with me
yesterday, and inquired after you.&nbsp; He was a lieutenant, and
is now broke, and upon half-pay.&nbsp; He asked me nothing for
himself; but wanted an employment for a friend, who would give a
handsome pair of gloves.&nbsp; One Hales sent me up a letter
t&rsquo;other day, which said you lodged in his house, and
therefore desired I would get him a civil employment.&nbsp; I
would not be within, and have directed my man to give him an
answer, that I never open letters brought me by the writers,
etc.&nbsp; I was complaining to a lady that I wanted to mend an
employment from forty to sixty pounds a year, in the Salt Office,
and thought it hard I could not do it.&nbsp; She told me one Mr.
Griffin <a name="citation471b"></a><a href="#footnote471b"
class="citation">[471b]</a> should do it.&nbsp; And afterward I
met Griffin at her lodgings; and he was, as I found, one I had
been acquainted with.&nbsp; I named Filby <a
name="citation471c"></a><a href="#footnote471c"
class="citation">[471c]</a> to him, and his abode somewhere near
Nantwich.&nbsp; He said frankly he had formerly examined the man,
and found he understood very little of his business; but if he
heard he mended, he would do what I desired.&nbsp; I will let it
rest a while, and then resume it; and if Ppt writes to Filby, she
may advise him to diligence, etc.&nbsp; I told Griffin positively
I would have it done, if the man mended.&nbsp; This is an account
of poo Ppt&rsquo;s commission to her most humble servant
Pdfr.&nbsp; I have a world of writing to finish, and little time;
these toads of Ministers are so slow in their helps.&nbsp; This
makes me sometimes steal a week from the exactness I used to
write to MD.&nbsp; Farewell, dee logues, deelest MD MD MD, . . .

protest solemnly I am not able to write to MD for other business,
but I will resume my journal method next time.&nbsp; I find it is
easier, though it contains nothing but where I dine, and the
occurrences of the day.&nbsp; I will write now but once in three
weeks till this business is off my hands, which must be in six, I
think, at farthest. O Ppt, I remember your reprimanding me for
meddling in other people&rsquo;s affairs: I have enough of it

have been here six times apiece; I never saw them yet.&nbsp; The
first I have despatched with a letter; the other I must see, and
tell her I can do nothing for her: she is wife of one Connor, <a
name="citation472c"></a><a href="#footnote472c"
class="citation">[472c]</a> an old college acquaintance, and
comes on a foolish errand, for some old pretensions, that will
succeed when I am Lord Treasurer.&nbsp; I am got [up] two pair of
stairs, in a private lodging, and have ordered all my friends not
to discover where I am; yet every morning two or three sots are
plaguing me, and my present servant has not yet his lesson
perfect of denying me.&nbsp; I have written a hundred and thirty
pages in folio, to be printed, and must write thirty more, which
will make a large book of four shillings. <a

Streets about the bandbox. <a name="citation473i"></a><a
href="#footnote473i" class="citation">[473i]</a>&nbsp; The Whig
papers have abused me about the bandbox.&nbsp; God help me, what
could I do?&nbsp; I fairly ventured my life.&nbsp; There is a
particular account of it in the <i>Postboy</i>, and Evening Post
of that day.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer has had the seal sent him that
sealed the box, and directions where to find the other pistol in
a tree in St. James&rsquo;s Park, which Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s
messenger found accordingly; but who sent the present is not yet
known.&nbsp; The Duke of Hamilton avoided the quarrel as much as
possible, according to the foppish rules of honour in
practice.&nbsp; What signified your writing angry to Filby?&nbsp;
I hope you said nothing of hearing <a name="page474"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 474</span>anything from me.&nbsp; Heigh! do oo

of lying-in is within two days of being out.&nbsp; I was at the
christening on Monday.&nbsp; I could not get the child named
Robin, after Lord Treasurer; it is Samuel, after the
father.&nbsp; My brother Ormond sent me some chocolate
to-day.&nbsp; I wish you had share of it: but they say &rsquo;tis
good for me, and I design to drink some in a morning.&nbsp; Our
Society meets next Thursday, now the Queen is in town; and Lord
Treasurer assures me that the Society for reforming the language
shall soon be established.&nbsp; I have given away ten shillings
to-day to servants; &rsquo;tan&rsquo;t be help if one should cry
one&rsquo;s eyes out. <a name="citation474"></a><a

is here about your company and visits!&nbsp; Charming company, no
doubt; now I keep no company at all, nor have I any desire to
keep any.&nbsp; I never go to a coffee-house nor a tavern, nor
have touched a card since I left Windsor.&nbsp; I make few
visits, nor go to levees; my only debauching is sitting late
where I dine, if I like the company.&nbsp; I have almost dropped
the Duchesses of Shrewsbury and Hamilton, and several
others.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer, the Duke of Ormond, and Lady Orkney
are all that I see very often.&nbsp; Oh yes, and Lady Masham and
Lord Bolingbroke, and one or two private friends.&nbsp; I make no
figure but at Court, where I affect to turn from a lord to the
meanest of my acquaintance, and I love to go there on Sundays to
see the world.&nbsp; But, to say the truth, I am growing weary of
it.&nbsp; I dislike a million of things in the course of public
affairs; and if I were to stay here much longer, I am sure I
should ruin myself with endeavouring to mend them.&nbsp; I am
every day invited into schemes of doing this, but I cannot find
any that will probably succeed.&nbsp; It is impossible to save
people against their own will; and I have been too much engaged
in patchwork already.&nbsp; Do you understand all this
stuff?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Well zen, you are now returned to ombre

savoys, plagues me every morning about this time; he is now at

class="citation">[475a]</a> to get some particulars for my
History.&nbsp; It was he who was first employed by France in the
overtures of peace, and I have not had time this month to see
him; he is but a puppy too.&nbsp; Lady Orkney has just sent to
invite me to dinner; she has not given me the bed-nightgown; <a
name="citation475b"></a><a href="#footnote475b"
class="citation">[475b]</a> besides, I am come very much off from
writing in bed, though I am doing it this minute; but I stay till
my fire is burnt up.&nbsp; My grate is very large; two bushels of
coals in a week: but I save it in lodgings.&nbsp; Lord Abercorn
is come to London, and will plague me, and I can do him no
service.&nbsp; The Duke of Shrewsbury goes in a day or two for
France, perhaps to-day.&nbsp; We shall have a peace very soon;
the Dutch are almost entirely agreed, and if they stop we shall
make it without them; that has been long resolved.&nbsp; One
Squire Jones, <a name="citation475c"></a><a href="#footnote475c"
class="citation">[475c]</a> a scoundrel in my parish, has writ to
me to desire I would engage Joe Beaumont to give him his interest
for Parliament-man for Trim: pray tell Joe this; and if he
designed to vote for him already, then he may tell Jones that I
received his letter, and that I writ to Joe to do it.&nbsp; If
Joe be engaged for any other, then he may do what he will: and
Parvisol may say he spoke to Joe, but Joe&rsquo;s engaged,
etc.&nbsp; I received three pair of fine thread stockings from
Joe lately.&nbsp; Pray thank him when you see him, and that I say
they are very fine and good.&nbsp; (I never looked at <a
name="page476"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 476</span>them yet,
but that&rsquo;s no matter.)&nbsp; This is a fine day.&nbsp; I am
ruined with coaches and chairs this twelvepenny weather.&nbsp; I
must see my brother Ormond at eleven, and then the Duchess of
Hamilton, with whom I doubt I am in disgrace, not having seen her
these ten days.&nbsp; I send this to-day, and must finish it now;
and perhaps some people may come and hinder me; for it im ten
o&rsquo;clock (but not shaving-day), and I must be abroad at
eleven.&nbsp; Abb&eacute; Gaultier sends me word I can&rsquo;t

anything but one letter he has of Petecum&rsquo;s, <a

Lord Harley, who was President this week, could not attend, being
gone to Wimbledon with his new brother-in-law, the young Marquis
of Caermarthen, who married Lady Betty Harley on Monday last; and
Lord Treasurer is at Wimbledon too.&nbsp; However, half a dozen
of us met, and I propose our meetings should be once a fortnight;
for, between you and me, we do no good.&nbsp; It cost me nineteen
shillings to-day for my Club at dinner; I don&rsquo;t like it,

Abercorn is come to town, and will see me, whether I will or
no.&nbsp; You know he has a pretence <a name="page477"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 477</span>to a dukedom in France, which the
Duke of Hamilton was soliciting for; but Abercorn resolves to
spoil their title, if they will not allow him a fourth part; and
I have advised the Duchess to compound with him, and have made
the Ministry of my opinion.&nbsp; Night, dee sollahs, MD, MD.</p>

class="citation">[477a]</a> for Pdfr to write journals
again!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as natural as mother&rsquo;s milk, now I
am got into it.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer is returned from Wimbledon
(&rsquo;tis not above eight miles off), and sent for me to dine
with him at five; but I had the grace to be abroad, and dined
with some others, with honest Ben Tooke, by invitation.&nbsp; The
Duchess of Ormond promised me her picture, and coming home
to-night, I found hers and the Duke&rsquo;s both in my
chamber.&nbsp; Was not that a pretty civil surprise?&nbsp; Yes,
and they are in fine gilded frames, too.&nbsp; I am writing a
letter to thank her, which I will send to-morrow morning.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll tell her she is such a prude that she will not let so
much as her picture be alone in a room with <i>a man</i>, unless
the Duke&rsquo;s be with it; and so forth. <a
name="citation477b"></a><a href="#footnote477b"

dabbling.&nbsp; Lady Masham has come abroad these three days, and
seen the Queen.&nbsp; I dined with her t&rsquo;other day at her
sister Hill&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I hope she will remove in a few days
to her new lodgings at St. James&rsquo;s from Kensington.&nbsp;
Nite, dee logues MD.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; I lodge [up] two pair of stairs, have but one room,
and deny myself to everybody almost, yet I cannot be quiet; and
all my mornings are lost with people, who will not take answers
below stairs; such as Dilly, and the Bishop, and Provost,
etc.&nbsp; Lady Orkney invited me to dinner to-day, which
hindered me from dining with Lord Treasurer.&nbsp; This is his
day that his chief friends in the Ministry dine with him.&nbsp;
However, I went there about six, and sat with them till past
nine, when they all went off; but he kept me back, <a
name="page478"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 478</span>and told me
the circumstances of Lady Betty&rsquo;s match.&nbsp; The young
fellow has &pound;60,000 ready money, three great houses
furnished, &pound;7,000 a year at present, and about five more
after his father and mother die.&nbsp; I think Lady Betty&rsquo;s
portion is not above &pound;8,000.&nbsp; I remember either
Tisdall writ to me in somebody&rsquo;s letter, or you did it for
him, that I should mention him on occasion to Lord Anglesea, with
whom, he said, he had some little acquaintance.&nbsp; Lord
Anglesea was with me to-night at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s; and then
I asked him about Tisdall, and described him.&nbsp; He said he
never saw him, but that he had sent him his book. <a
name="citation478a"></a><a href="#footnote478a"
class="citation">[478a]</a>&nbsp; See what it is to be a
puppy.&nbsp; Pray tell Mr. Walls that Lord Anglesea thanked me
for recommending Clements <a name="citation478b"></a><a
href="#footnote478b" class="citation">[478b]</a> to him; that he
says he is &pound;20,000 the better for knowing Clements.&nbsp;
But pray don&rsquo;t let Clements go and write a letter of
thanks, and tell my lord that he hears so and so, etc.&nbsp; Why,
&rsquo;tis but like an Irish understanding to do so.&nbsp; Sad
weather; two shillings in coaches to-day, and yet I am
dirty.&nbsp; I am now going to read over something and correct
it.&nbsp; So, nite.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; Puppies have got a new way of plaguing me.&nbsp; I
find letters directed for me at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s, sometimes
with enclosed ones to him, and sometimes with projects, and some
times with libels.&nbsp; I usually keep them three or four days
without opening.&nbsp; I was at Court to-day, as I always am on
Sundays, instead of a coffee-house, to see my acquaintance.&nbsp;
This day se&rsquo;nnight, after I had been talking at Court with
Sir William Wyndham, the Spanish Ambassador <a
name="citation478c"></a><a href="#footnote478c"
class="citation">[478c]</a> came to him and said he heard that
was Dr. Swift, and desired him to tell me that his master, and
the King of France, and the Queen, were more obliged to me than
any man in Europe; so we bowed, and shook hands, etc.&nbsp; I
took it very well of him.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Treasurer, and
must again to-morrow, though I had rather not (as DD says); but
now the Queen is in town, he does not keep me so late.&nbsp; I
have not had time to see Fanny Manley since she came, but intend
it one of these <a name="page479"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
479</span>days.&nbsp; Her uncle, Jack Manley, <a
name="citation479a"></a><a href="#footnote479a"
class="citation">[479a]</a> I hear, cannot live a month, which
will be a great loss to her father in Ireland, for I believe he
is one of his chief supports.&nbsp; Our peace now will soon be
determined; for Lord Bolingbroke tells me this morning that four
provinces of Holland <a name="citation479b"></a><a
href="#footnote479b" class="citation">[479b]</a> have complied
with the Queen, and we expect the rest will do so
immediately.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; Lord Keeper promised me yesterday the first
convenient living to poor Mr. Gery, <a name="citation479c"></a><a
href="#footnote479c" class="citation">[479c]</a> who is married,
and wants some addition to what he has.&nbsp; He is a very worthy
creature.&nbsp; I had a letter some weeks ago from Elwick, <a
name="citation479d"></a><a href="#footnote479d"
class="citation">[479d]</a> who married Betty Gery.&nbsp; It
seems the poor woman died some time last summer.&nbsp; Elwick
grows rich, and purchases lands.&nbsp; I dined with Lord
Treasurer to-day, who has engaged me to come again
to-morrow.&nbsp; I gave Lord Bolingbroke a poem of
Parnell&rsquo;s. <a name="citation479e"></a><a
href="#footnote479e" class="citation">[479e]</a>&nbsp; I made
Parnell insert some compliments in it to his lordship.&nbsp; He
is extremely pleased with it, and read some parts of it to-day to
Lord Treasurer, who liked it as much.&nbsp; And indeed he outdoes
all our poets here a bar&rsquo;s length.&nbsp; Lord Bolingbroke
has ordered me to bring him to dinner on Christmas Day, and I
made Lord Treasurer promise to see him; and it may one day do
Parnell a kindness.&nbsp; You know Parnell.&nbsp; I believe I
have told you of that poem.&nbsp; Nite, deel MD.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; This morning I presented one Diaper, <a
name="citation479f"></a><a href="#footnote479f"

serves a small cure in the country; but has a sword at his

wretch, but will do best in a gown, and we will make Lord Keeper

acquaintance with one Eckershall, <a name="citation480b"></a><a

Kitchen to the Queen, who was civil to him at Windsor on my
account; for I had done some service to Eckershall.&nbsp; Leigh
teases me to pass an evening at his lodgings with
Eckershall.&nbsp; I put it off several times, but was forced at
last to promise I would come to-night; and it never was in my
head till I was locked up, and I have called and called, but my
man is gone to bed; so I will write an excuse to-morrow.&nbsp; I
detest that Tom Leigh, and am as formal to him as I can when I
happen to meet him in the Park.&nbsp; The rogue frets me, if he
knew it.&nbsp; He asked me why I did not wait on the Bishop of
Dromore. <a name="citation480c"></a><a href="#footnote480c"
class="citation">[480c]</a>&nbsp; I answered I had not the honour
to be acquainted with him, and would not presume, etc.&nbsp; He
takes me seriously, and says the Bishop is no proud man,
etc.&nbsp; He tells me of a judge in Ireland that has done ill
things.&nbsp; I ask why he is not out?&nbsp; Says he, &ldquo;I
think the bishops, and you, and I, and the rest of the clergy,
should meet and consult about it.&rdquo;&nbsp; I beg his pardon,
and say, &ldquo;I cannot be serviceable that way.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
answers, &ldquo;Yes, everybody may help
something.&rdquo;&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you see how curiously he
contrives to vex me; for the dog knows that with half a word I
could do more than all of them together.&nbsp; But he only does
it from the pride and envy of his own heart, and not out of a
humorous design of teasing.&nbsp; He is one of those that would
rather a service should not be done, than done by a private man,

<p>24.&nbsp; I dined to-day with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
in order to look over some of my papers; but nothing was
done.&nbsp; I have been also mediating between the Hamilton
family and Lord Abercorn, to have them compound with him; and I
believe they will do it.&nbsp; Lord Selkirk, <a

Lord Bolingbroke is mightily pleased with him.&nbsp; I was at St.

sacrament were done by ten.&nbsp; The Queen has the gout in her
hand, and did not come to church to-day; and I stayed so long in
my chamber that I missed going to Court.&nbsp; Did I tell you
that the Queen designs to have a Drawing-room and company every
day?&nbsp; Nite dee logues.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; I was to wish the Duke of Ormond a happy Christmas,
and give half a crown to his porter.&nbsp; It will cost me a
dozen half-crowns among such fellows.&nbsp; I dined with Lord
Treasurer, who chid me for being absent three days.&nbsp; Mighty
kind, with a p&mdash;; less of civility, and more of his
interest!&nbsp; We hear Maccartney is gone over to Ireland.&nbsp;
Was it not comical for a gentleman to be set upon by highwaymen,
and to tell them he was Maccartney?&nbsp; Upon which they brought
him to a justice of peace, in hopes of the reward, <a

class="citation">[481c]</a> and the rogues were sent to
gaol.&nbsp; Was it not great presence of mind?&nbsp; But maybe
you heard this already; for there was a Grub Street of it.&nbsp;
Lord Bolingbroke told me I must walk away to-day when dinner was
done, because Lord Treasurer, <a name="page482"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 482</span>and he, and another, were to enter
upon business; but I said it was as fit I should know their
business as anybody, for I was to justify [it]. <a

<p>27.&nbsp; I dined to-day with General Hill, Governor of
Dunkirk.&nbsp; Lady Masham and Mrs. Hill, his two sisters, were
of the company, and there have I been sitting this evening till
eleven, looking over others at play; for I have left off loving
play myself; and I think Ppt is now a great gamester.&nbsp; I
have a great cold on me, not quite at its height.&nbsp; I have
them seldom, and therefore ought to be patient.&nbsp; I met Mr.
Addison and Pastoral Philips on the Mall to-day, and took a turn
with them; but they both looked terrible dry and cold.&nbsp; A
curse of party!&nbsp; And do you know I have taken more pains to
recommend the Whig wits to the favour and mercy of the Ministers
than any other people.&nbsp; Steele I have kept in his
place.&nbsp; Congreve I have got to be used kindly, and
secured.&nbsp; Rowe I have recommended, and got a promise of a
place.&nbsp; Philips I could certainly have provided for, if he
had not run party mad, and made me withdraw my recommendation;
and I set Addison so right at first that he might have been
employed, and have partly secured him the place he has; yet I am
worse used by that faction than any man.&nbsp; Well, go to cards,
sollah Ppt, and dress the wine and olange, sollah MD, and
I&rsquo;ll go seep.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis rate.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; My cold is so bad that I could not go to church
to-day, nor to Court; but I was engaged to Lord Orkney&rsquo;s
with the Duke of Ormond, at dinner; and ventured, because I could
cough and spit there as I pleased.&nbsp; The Duke and Lord Arran
left us, and I have been sitting ever since with Lord and Lady
Orkney till past eleven: and my cold is worse, and makes me
giddy.&nbsp; I hope it is only my cold.&nbsp; Oh, says Ppt,
everybody is giddy with a cold; I hope it is no more; but
I&rsquo;ll go to bed, for the fellow has bawled &ldquo;Past

and truly he was gone out too.&nbsp; I dined in the City upon the
broiled leg of a goose and a bit of brawn, with my printer.&nbsp;
Did I tell you that I forbear printing what I have in hand, till
the Court decides something about me?&nbsp; I will contract no
more enemies, at least I will not embitter worse those I have
already, till I have got under shelter; and the Ministers know my

as soon as you expected.&nbsp; I hear Lord Treasurer is out of

six.&nbsp; One Mrs. Ramsay dined with us; an old lady of about
fifty-five, that we are all very fond of.&nbsp; I called this
evening at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s, and sat with him two
hours.&nbsp; He has been cupped for a cold, and has been very
ill.&nbsp; He cannot dine with Parnell and me at Lord
Bolingbroke&rsquo;s to-morrow, but says he will see Parnell some
other time.&nbsp; I hoise <a name="citation483b"></a><a

partly to spite the envious Irish folks here, particularly Tom

<p>31.&nbsp; To-day Parnell and I dined with Lord Bolingbroke, to
correct Parnell&rsquo;s poem.&nbsp; I made him show all the
places he disliked; and when Parnell has corrected it fully he
shall print it.&nbsp; I went this evening to sit with Lord
Treasurer.&nbsp; He is better, and will be out in a day or
two.&nbsp; I sat with him while the young folks went to supper;
and then went down, and there were the young folks merry
together, having turned Lady Oxford up to my lord, and I stayed
with them till twelve.&nbsp; There was the young couple, Lord and
Lady <a name="page484"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

and I; and the old folks were together above.&nbsp; It looked
like what I have formerly done so often; stealing together from
the old folks, though indeed it was not from poor Lord Treasurer,
who is as young a fellow as any of us: but Lady Oxford is a silly
mere old woman. <a name="citation484a"></a><a

Almighty bless you, and send you ever happy!&nbsp; I forgot to
tell you that yesterday Lord Abercorn was here, teasing me about
his French duchy, and suspecting my partiality to the Hamilton
family in such a whimsical manner that Dr. Pratt, who was by,
thought he was mad.&nbsp; He was no sooner gone but Lord Orkney
sent to know whether he might come and sit with me half an hour
upon some business.&nbsp; I returned answer that I would wait on
him; which I did.&nbsp; We discoursed a while, and he left me
with Lady Orkney; and in came the Earl of Selkirk, whom I had
never seen before.&nbsp; He is another brother of the Duke of
Hamilton, and is going to France, by a power from his mother, the
old Duchess, <a name="citation484c"></a><a href="#footnote484c"
class="citation">[484c]</a> to negotiate their pretensions to the
duchy of Chatelherault.&nbsp; He teased me for two hours in spite
of my teeth, and held my hand when I offered to stir; would have
had me engage the Ministry to favour him against Lord Abercorn,
and to convince them that Lord Abercorn had no pretensions; and
desired I would also convince Lord Abercorn himself so; and
concluded he was sorry I was a greater friend to Abercorn than
Hamilton.&nbsp; <a name="page485"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
485</span>I had no patience, and used him with some
plainness.&nbsp; Am not I purely handled between a couple of
puppies?&nbsp; Ay, says Ppt, you must be meddling in other
folks&rsquo; affairs.&nbsp; I appeal to the Bishop of Clogher
whether Abercorn did not complain that I would not let him see me
last year, and that he swore he would take no denial from my
servant when he came again.&nbsp; The Ministers gave me leave to
tell the Hamilton family it was their opinion that they ought to
agree with Abercorn.&nbsp; Lord Anglesea was then by, and told
Abercorn; upon which he gravely tells me I was commissioned by
the Ministers, and ought to perform my commission, etc.&mdash;But
I&rsquo;ll have done with them.&nbsp; I have warned Lord
Treasurer and Lord Bolingbroke to beware of Selkirk&rsquo;s
teasing, &mdash;x on him!&nbsp; Yet Abercorn vexes me more.&nbsp;
The whelp owes to me all the kind receptions he has had from the
Ministry.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s with the
young folks, and sat with Lord Treasurer till nine, and then was
forced to Lady Masham&rsquo;s, and sat there till twelve, talking
of affairs, till I am out of humour, as everyone must that knows
them inwardly.&nbsp; A thousand things wrong, most of them easy
to mend; yet our schemes availing at best but little, and
sometimes nothing at all.&nbsp; One evil, which I twice patched
up with the hazard of all the credit I had, is now spread more
than ever. <a name="citation485a"></a><a href="#footnote485a"

Pratt to a picture auction, where I had like to be drawn in to
buy a picture that I was fond of, but, it seems, was good for
nothing.&nbsp; Pratt was there to buy some pictures for the
Bishop of Clogher, who resolves to lay out ten pounds to furnish
his house with curious pieces.&nbsp; We dined with the Bishop, I
being by chance disengaged.&nbsp; And this evening I sat with the
Bishop of Ossory, <a name="citation485b"></a><a

died yesterday at her country house.&nbsp; The poor creature was

excessive concern for her loss.&nbsp; I hardly knew a more
valuable person on all accounts.&nbsp; You must have heard me

extremely moving.&nbsp; Her lord&rsquo;s a puppy; and I shall
never think it worth my while to be troubled with him, now he has
lost all that was valuable in his possession; yet I think he used
her pretty well.&nbsp; I hate life when I think it exposed to
such accidents; and to see so many thousand wretches burdening
the earth, while such as her die, makes me think God did never
intend life for a blessing.&nbsp; Farewell.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Jan.</i> 4, 1712&ndash;13.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">ended</span> my last with the melancholy
news of poor Lady Ashburnham&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The Bishop of
Clogher and Dr. Pratt made me dine with them to-day at Lord
Mountjoy&rsquo;s, pursuant to an engagement, which I had
forgot.&nbsp; Lady Mountjoy told me that Maccartney was got safe
out of our clutches, for she had spoke with one who had a letter
from him from Holland.&nbsp; Others say the same thing.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis hard such a dog should escape.&mdash;As I left Lord
Mountjoy&rsquo;s I saw the Duke d&rsquo;Aumont, the French
Ambassador, going from Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s, where he dined,
to have a private audience of the Queen.&nbsp; I followed, and
went up to Court, where there was a great crowd.&nbsp; I was
talking with the Duke of Argyle by the fireside in the
bed-chamber, when the Ambassador came out from the Queen.&nbsp;
Argyle presented me to him, and Lord Bolingbroke and we talked
together a while.&nbsp; He is a fine gentleman, something like
the Duke of Ormond, and just such an expensive man.&nbsp; After
church to-day I showed the Bishop of Clogher, at Court, who was

Treasurer is recovered, and went out this evening to the <a
name="page488"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
488</span>Queen.&nbsp; I dined with Lady Oxford, and then sat
with Lord Treasurer while he went out.&nbsp; He gave me a letter
from an unknown hand, relating to Dr. Brown, <a
name="citation488a"></a><a href="#footnote488a"
class="citation">[488a]</a> Bishop of Cork, recommending him to a
better bishopric, as a person who opposed Lord Wharton, and was
made a bishop on that account, celebrating him for a great
politician, etc.: in short, all directly contrary to his
character, which I made bold to explain.&nbsp; What dogs there
are in the world!&nbsp; I was to see the poor Duke and Duchess of
Ormond this morning.&nbsp; The Duke was in his public room, with
Mr. Southwell <a name="citation488b"></a><a href="#footnote488b"
class="citation">[488b]</a> and two more gentlemen.&nbsp; When
Southwell and I were alone with him, he talked something of Lord
Ashburnham, that he was afraid the Whigs would get him
again.&nbsp; He bore up as well as he could, but something
falling accidentally in discourse, the tears were just falling
out of his eyes, and I looked off to give him an opportunity
(which he took) of wiping them with his handkerchief.&nbsp; I
never saw anything so moving, nor such a mixture of greatness of
mind, and tenderness, and discretion.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Lord Bolingbroke and Parnell and I dined, by
invitation, with my friend Darteneuf, <a
name="citation488c"></a><a href="#footnote488c"
class="citation">[488c]</a> whom you have heard me talk of.&nbsp;
Lord Bolingbroke likes Parnell mightily; and it is pleasant to
see that one who hardly passed for anything in Ireland makes his
way here with a little friendly forwarding.&nbsp; It is scurvy
rainy weather, and I have hardly been abroad to-day, nor know
anything that passes.&mdash;Lord Treasurer is quite recovered,
and I hope will be careful to keep himself well.&nbsp; The
Duchess of Marlborough is leaving England to go to her Duke, and
makes presents of rings to several friends, they say worth two
hundred pounds apiece.&nbsp; I am sure she ought to give me one,
though the Duke pretended to think me his greatest enemy, and got
people to tell me so, and very mildly to let me know how gladly
he would have me softened toward him.&nbsp; I bid a lady of his
acquaintance and mine let him know that I had hindered many a
bitter <a name="page489"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
489</span>thing against him; not for his own sake, but because I
thought it looked base; and I desired everything should be left
him, except power.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; I dined with Lord and Lady Masham to-day, and this
evening played at ombre with Mrs. Vanhom, merely for
amusement.&nbsp; The Ministers have got my papers, and will
neither read them nor give them to me; and I can hardly do
anything.&nbsp; Very warm slabby weather, but I made a shift to
get a walk; yet I lost half of it, by shaking off Lord Rochester,
<a name="citation489a"></a><a href="#footnote489a"
class="citation">[489a]</a> who is a good, civil, simple
man.&nbsp; The Bishop of Ossory will not be Bishop of Hereford,
<a name="citation489b"></a><a href="#footnote489b"
class="citation">[489b]</a> to the great grief of himself and his
wife.&nbsp; And hat is MD doing now, I wonder?&nbsp; Playing at
cards with the Dean and Mrs. Walls?&nbsp; I think it is not
certain yet that Maccartney is escaped.&nbsp; I am plagued with
bad authors, verse and prose, who send me their books and poems,
the vilest trash I ever saw; but I have given their names to my
man, never to let them see me.&nbsp; I have got new ink, and
&rsquo;tis very white; and I don&rsquo;t see that it turns black
at all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go to seep; &rsquo;tis past

<p>8.&nbsp; Oo must understand that I am in my geers, and have
got a chocolate-pot, a present from Mrs. Ashe of Clogher, and
some chocolate from my brother Ormond, and I treat folks
sometimes.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Treasurer at five
o&rsquo;clock to-day, and was by while he and Lord Bolingbroke
were at business; for it is fit I should know all that passes
now, because, etc.&nbsp; The Duke of Ormond employed me to speak
to Lord Treasurer to-day about an affair, and I did so; and the
Duke had spoke himself two hours before, which vexed me, and I
will chide the Duke about it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you a good
thing; there is not one of the Ministry but what will employ me
as gravely to speak for them to Lord Treasurer as if I were their
brother or his; and I do it as gravely: though I know they do it
only because they will not make themselves <a
name="page490"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 490</span>uneasy, or
had rather I should be denied than they.&nbsp; I believe our
peace will not be finished these two months; for I think we must
have a return from Spain by a messenger, who will not go till
Sunday next.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer has invited me to dine with him
again to-morrow.&nbsp; Your Commissioner, Keatley, <a

then we walked.&nbsp; I was yesterday with him to see Lady Betty
Butler, grieving for her sister Ashburnham.&nbsp; The jade was in
bed in form, and she did so cant, she made me sick.&nbsp; I meet
Tom Leigh every day in the Park, to preserve his health.&nbsp; He
is as ruddy as a rose, and tells me his Bishop of Dromore <a
name="citation490c"></a><a href="#footnote490c"
class="citation">[490c]</a> recovers very much.&nbsp; That Bishop
has been very near dying.&nbsp; This day&rsquo;s <i>Examiner</i>
talks of the play of &ldquo;What is it like?&rdquo; <a
name="citation490d"></a><a href="#footnote490d"
class="citation">[490d]</a> and you will think it to be mine, and
be bit; for I have no hand in these papers at all.&nbsp; I dined
with Lord Treasurer, and shall again to-morrow, which is his day
when all the Ministers dine with him.&nbsp; He calls it
whipping-day.&nbsp; It is always on Saturday, and we do indeed
usually rally him about his faults on that day.&nbsp; I was of
the original Club, when only poor Lord Rivers, Lord Keeper, and
Lord Bolingbroke came; but now Ormond, Anglesea, Lord Steward, <a
name="citation490e"></a><a href="#footnote490e"
class="citation">[490e]</a> Dartmouth, and other rabble intrude,
and I scold at it; but now they pretend as good a title as I;
and, indeed, many Saturdays I am not there.&nbsp; The company
being too many, I don&rsquo;t love it.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; At seven this evening, as we sat after dinner at
Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s, a servant said Lord Peterborow was at the
door.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer and Lord Bolingbroke went out to meet
him, and brought him in.&nbsp; He was just returned from abroad,
<a name="page491"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 491</span>where he
has been above a year.&nbsp; Soon as he saw me, he left the Duke
of Ormond and other lords, and ran and kissed me before he spoke
to them; but chid me terribly for not writing to him, which I
never did this last time he was abroad, not knowing where he was;
and he changed places so often, it was impossible a letter should
overtake him.&nbsp; He left England with a bruise, by his coach
overturning, that made him spit blood, and was so ill, we
expected every post to hear of his death; but he outrode it or
outdrank it, or something, and is come home lustier than
ever.&nbsp; He is at least sixty, and has more spirits than any
young fellow I know in England.&nbsp; He has got the old Oxford
regiment of horse, and I believe will have a Garter.&nbsp; I love
the hang-dog dearly.&nbsp; Nite dee MD.</p>

class="citation">[491a]</a> the French Ambassador; but he did not
come.&nbsp; Did I never tell you that I go to Court on Sundays as
to a coffee-house, to see acquaintance, whom I should otherwise
not see twice a year?&nbsp; The Provost <a
name="citation491b"></a><a href="#footnote491b"
class="citation">[491b]</a> and I dined with Ned Southwell, by
appointment, in order to settle your kingdom, if my scheme can be
followed; but I doubt our Ministry will be too tedious.&nbsp; You
must certainly have a new Parliament; but they would have that a
secret yet.&nbsp; Our Parliament here will be prorogued for three
weeks.&nbsp; Those puppies the Dutch will not yet come in, though
they pretend to submit to the Queen in everything; but they would
fain try first how our session begins, in hopes to embroil us in
the House of Lords: and if my advice had been taken, the session
should have begun, and we would have trusted the Parliament to
approve the steps already made toward the peace, and had an
Address perhaps from them to conclude without the Dutch, if they
would not agree.&mdash;Others are of my mind, but it is not
reckoned so safe, it seems; yet I doubt whether the peace will be
ready so soon as three weeks, but that is a secret.&nbsp; Nite

<p>12.&nbsp; Pratt and I walked into the City to one
Bateman&rsquo;s, <a name="citation491c"></a><a
href="#footnote491c" class="citation">[491c]</a> a <a
name="page492"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 492</span>famous
bookseller, for old books.&nbsp; There I laid out four pounds
like a fool, and we dined at a hedge ale-house, for two shillings
and twopence, like emperors.&nbsp; Let me see, I bought Plutarch,
two volumes, for thirty shillings, etc.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll
tell you no more; oo don&rsquo;t understand Greek. <a
name="citation492a"></a><a href="#footnote492a"
class="citation">[492a]</a>&nbsp; We have no news, and I have
nothing more to say to-day, and I can&rsquo;t finish my
work.&nbsp; These Ministers will not find time to do what I would
have them.&nbsp; So nite, nown dee dallars.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; I was to have dined to-day with Lord Keeper, but
would not, because that brute Sir John Walter <a
name="citation492b"></a><a href="#footnote492b"
class="citation">[492b]</a> was to be one of the company.&nbsp;
You may remember he railed at me last summer was twelvemonth at
Windsor, and has never begged my pardon, though he promised to do
it; and Lord Mansel, who was one of the company, would certainly
have set us together by the ears, out of pure roguish
mischief.&nbsp; So I dined with Lord Treasurer, where there was
none but Lord Bolingbroke.&nbsp; I stayed till eight, and then
went to Lady Orkney&rsquo;s, who has been sick, and sat with her
till twelve, from whence you may consider it is late,
sollahs.&nbsp; The Parliament was prorogued to-day, as I told
you, for three weeks.&nbsp; Our weather is very bad and slobbery,
and I shall spoil my new hat (I have bought a new hat), or empty
my pockets.&nbsp; Does Hawkshaw pay the interest he owes?&nbsp;
Lord Abercorn plagues me to death.&nbsp; I have now not above six
people to provide for, and about as many to do good offices to;
and thrice as many that I will do nothing for; nor can I if I
would.&nbsp; Nite dee MD.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; To-day I took the circle of morning visits.&nbsp; I
went to the Duchess of Ormond, and there was she, and Lady Betty,
and Lord Ashburnham together: this was the first time the mother
and daughter saw each other since Lady Ashburnham&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; They were both in tears, and I chid them for being
together, and made Lady Betty go to her own chamber; then sat a
while with the Duchess, and went after Lady Betty, and all was
well.&nbsp; There is something of farce in all these mournings,
let them be ever so serious.&nbsp; People will <a
name="page493"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 493</span>pretend to
grieve more than they really do, and that takes off from their
true grief.&nbsp; I then went to the Duchess of Hamilton, who
never grieved, but raged, and stormed, and railed. <a
name="citation493a"></a><a href="#footnote493a"
class="citation">[493a]</a>&nbsp; She is pretty quiet now, but
has a diabolical temper.&nbsp; Lord Keeper and his son, and their
two ladies, and I, dined to-day with Mr. C&aelig;sar, <a
name="citation493b"></a><a href="#footnote493b"
class="citation">[493b]</a> Treasurer of the Navy, at his house
in the City, where he keeps his office.&nbsp; We happened to talk
of Brutus, and I said something in his praise, when it struck me
immediately that I had made a blunder in doing so; and,
therefore, I recollected myself, and said, &ldquo;Mr.
C&aelig;sar, I beg your pardon.&rdquo;&nbsp; So we laughed,
etc.&nbsp; Nite, my own deelest richar logues, MD.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; I forgot to tell you that last night I had a present
sent me (I found it, when I came home, in my chamber) of the
finest wild fowl I ever saw, with the vilest letter, and from the
vilest poet in the world, who sent it me as a bribe to get him an
employment.&nbsp; I knew not where the scoundrel lived, so I
could not send them back, and therefore I gave them away as
freely as I got them, and have ordered my man never to let up the
poet when he comes.&nbsp; The rogue should have kept the wings at
least for his muse.&nbsp; One of his fowls was a large capon
pheasant, as fat as a pullet.&nbsp; I ate share of it to-day with
a friend.&nbsp; We have now a Drawing-room every Wednesday,
Thursday, and Saturday at one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The Queen does
not come out; but all her Ministers, foreigners, and persons of
quality are at it.&nbsp; I was there to-day; and as Lord
Treasurer came towards me, I avoided him, and he hunted me thrice
about the room.&nbsp; I affect never to take notice of him at
church or Court.&nbsp; He knows it, for I have told him so; and
to-night, at Lord Masham&rsquo;s, he gave an account of it to the
company; but my reasons are, that people seeing me speak to him
causes a great deal of teasing.&nbsp; I tell you what comes into
my head, that I never knew whether MD were Whigs or Tories, and I
<a name="page494"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 494</span>value
our conversation the more that it never turned on that
subject.&nbsp; I have a fancy that Ppt is a Tory, and a violent
one.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why; but methinks she looks like
one, and DD a sort of a Trimmer.&nbsp; Am I right?&nbsp; I gave
the Examiner a hint about this prorogation, and to praise the
Queen for her tenderness to the Dutch in giving them still more
time to submit. <a name="citation494a"></a><a
href="#footnote494a" class="citation">[494a]</a>&nbsp; It fitted
the occasions at present.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; I was busy to-day at the Secretary&rsquo;s office,
and stayed till past three.&nbsp; The Duke of Ormond and I were
to dine at Lord Orkney&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The Duke was at the
Committee, so I thought all was safe.&nbsp; When I went there,
they had almost dined; for the Duke had sent to excuse himself,
which I never knew.&nbsp; I came home at seven, and began a
little whim, which just came into my head; and will make a
threepenny pamphlet. <a name="citation494b"></a><a
href="#footnote494b" class="citation">[494b]</a>&nbsp; It shall
be finished and out in a week; and if it succeeds, you shall know
what it is; otherwise, not.&nbsp; I cannot send this to-morrow,
and will put it off till next Saturday, because I have much
business.&nbsp; So my journals shall be short, and Ppt must have
patience.&nbsp; So nite, dee sollahs.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; This rogue Parnell has not yet corrected his poem,
and I would fain have it out.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord
Treasurer, and his Saturday company, nine of us in all.&nbsp;
They went away at seven, and Lord Treasurer and I sat talking an
hour after.&nbsp; After dinner he was talking to the lords about
the speech the Queen must make when the Parliament meets.&nbsp;
He asked me how I would make it.&nbsp; I was going to be serious,
because it was seriously put; but I turned it to a jest.&nbsp;
And because they had been speaking of <a name="page495"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 495</span>the Duchess of Marlborough going to
Flanders after the Duke, I said the speech should begin thus:
&ldquo;My Lords and Gentlemen, In order to my own quiet, and that
of my subjects, I have thought fit to send the Duchess of
Marlborough abroad after the Duke.&rdquo;&nbsp; This took well,
and turned off the discourse.&nbsp; I must tell you I do not at
all like the present situation of affairs, and remember I tell
you so.&nbsp; Things must be on another foot, or we are all
undone.&nbsp; I hate this driving always to an inch.&nbsp; Nite
MD.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; We had a mighty full Court to-day.&nbsp; Dilly was
with me at the French church, and edified mightily.&nbsp; The
Duke of Ormond and I dined at Lord Orkney&rsquo;s; but I left
them at seven, and came home to my whim.&nbsp; I have made a
great progress.&nbsp; My large Treatise <a
name="citation495a"></a><a href="#footnote495a"
class="citation">[495a]</a> stands stock still.&nbsp; Some think
it too dangerous to publish, and would have me print only what
relates to the peace.&nbsp; I cannot tell what I shall
do.&mdash;The Bishop of Dromore is dying.&nbsp; They thought
yesterday he could not live two hours; yet he is still alive, but
is utterly past all hopes.&nbsp; Go to cards, sollahs, and
nite.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; I was this morning to see the Duke and Duchess of
Ormond.&nbsp; The Duke d&rsquo;Aumont came in while I was with
the Duke of Ormond, and we complimented each other like
dragons.&nbsp; A poor fellow called at the door where I lodge,
with a parcel of oranges for a present for me.&nbsp; I bid my man
know what his name was, and whence he came.&nbsp; He sent word
his name was Bun, and that I knew him very well.&nbsp; I bid my
man tell him I was busy, and he could not speak to me; and not to
let him leave his oranges.&nbsp; I know no more of it, but I am
sure I never heard the name, and I shall take no such presents
from strangers.&nbsp; Perhaps he might be only some beggar, who
wanted a little money.&nbsp; Perhaps it might be something
worse.&nbsp; Let them keep their poison for their rats.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t love it. <a name="citation495b"></a><a

the Chancellor of the Exchequer.&nbsp; Our Society does not meet
now as usual, for which I am blamed: but till Lord Treasurer will
agree to give us money and employments to bestow, I am averse to
it; and he gives us nothing but promises.&nbsp; The Bishop of
Dromore is still alive, and that is all.&nbsp; We expect every
day he will die, and then Tom Leigh must go back, which is one
good thing to the town.&nbsp; I believe Pratt will drive at one
of these bishoprics.&nbsp; Our English bishopric <a

believe the peace will not be ready by the session.&nbsp; Nite
MD.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; I was to-day with my printer, to give him a little
pamphlet I have written, but not politics.&nbsp; It will be out
by Monday.&nbsp; If it succeeds, I will tell you of it;
otherwise, not.&nbsp; We had a prodigious thaw to-day, as bad as
rain; yet I walked like a good boy all the way.&nbsp; The Bishop
of Dromore still draws breath, but cannot live two days
longer.&nbsp; My large book lies flat.&nbsp; Some people think a
great part of it ought not to be now printed.&nbsp; I believe I
told you so before.&nbsp; This letter shall not go till Saturday,
which makes up the three weeks exactly; and I allow MD six weeks,
which are now almost out; so oo must know I expect a rettle vely

<p>22.&nbsp; This is one of our Court days, and I was
there.&nbsp; I told you there is a Drawing-room, Wednesday,
Thursday, and Saturday.&nbsp; The Hamiltons and Abercorns have
done teasing me.&nbsp; The latter, I hear, is actually going to
France.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer quarrelled with me at Court for
being four days without dining with him; so I dined there to-day,
and he has at last fallen in with my project (as he calls it) of
coining halfpence and farthings, with devices, like medals, in
honour of the Queen, every year changing the device.&nbsp; I wish
it may be done.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; The Duke of Ormond and I appointed to dine with Ned
Southwell to-day, to talk of settling your affairs of Parliament
in Ireland, but there was a mixture of company, and the <a
name="page497"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 497</span>Duke of
Ormond was in haste, and nothing was done.&nbsp; If your
Parliament meets this summer, it must be a new one; but I find
some are of opinion there should be none at all these two
years.&nbsp; I will trouble myself no more about it.&nbsp; My
design was to serve the Duke of Ormond.&nbsp; Dr. Pratt and I sat
this evening with the Bishop of Clogher, and played at ombre for
threepences.&nbsp; That, I suppose, is but low with you.&nbsp; I
found, at coming home, a letter from MD, N. 37.&nbsp; I shall not

do, who might do more good.&nbsp; All his friends repine, and
shrug their shoulders; but will not deal with him so freely as
they ought.&nbsp; It is an odd business; the Parliament just
going to sit, and no employments given.&nbsp; They say they will

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Jan.</i> 25, 1712&ndash;1713.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had such a terrible storm
to-day, that, going to Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s, I saw a hundred
tiles fallen down; and one swinger fell about forty yards before
me, that would have killed a horse: so, after church and Court, I
walked through the Park, and took a chair to Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Next door to his house, a tin chimneytop
had fallen down, with a hundred bricks.&nbsp; It is grown calm
this evening.&nbsp; I wonder had you such a wind to-day?&nbsp; I
hate it as much as any hog does.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer has engaged
me to dine again with him to-morrow.&nbsp; He has those tricks
sometimes of inviting me from day to day, which I am forced to
break through.&nbsp; My little pamphlet <a
name="citation498b"></a><a href="#footnote498b"
class="citation">[498b]</a> is out: &rsquo;tis not
politics.&nbsp; If it takes, I say again you shall hear of
it.&nbsp; Nite dee logues.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; This morning I felt a little touch of giddiness,
which has disordered and weakened me with its ugly remains all
this day.&nbsp; Pity Pdfr.&nbsp; After dinner at Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s, the French Ambassador, Duke d&rsquo;Aumont,
sent Lord Treasurer word that his house was burnt down to the
ground.&nbsp; It took fire in the upper rooms, while he was at
dinner with Monteleon, the Spanish Ambassador, and other persons;
and soon after Lord Bolingbroke came to us with the same
story.&nbsp; We are full of speculations upon it, but I believe
it was the carelessness of his French rascally servants.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis odd that this very day Lord Somers, Wharton,
Sunderland, Halifax, and the whole club of Whig lords, dined at
Pontack&rsquo;s <a name="citation498c"></a><a
href="#footnote498c" class="citation">[498c]</a> in the City, as
I received private notice.&nbsp; They have some damned
design.&nbsp; I tell you another odd thing; I was observing it to
Lord Treasurer, that he was stabbed on the day King William died;
and the day I saved his life, by opening the bandbox, <a
name="citation498d"></a><a href="#footnote498d"
class="citation">[498d]</a> was King William&rsquo;s
birthday.&nbsp; My friend Mr. Lewis has had a lie spread on him
by the mistake <a name="page499"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
499</span>of a man, who went to another of his name, to give him
thanks for passing his Privy Seal to come from France. <a
name="citation499a"></a><a href="#footnote499a"
class="citation">[499a]</a>&nbsp; That other Lewis spread about
that the man brought him thanks from Lord Perth and Lord Melfort
(two lords with the Pretender), for his great services,
etc.&nbsp; The Lords will examine that t&rsquo;other Lewis
to-morrow in council; and I believe you will hear of it in the
prints, for I will make Abel Roper give a relation of it.&nbsp;
Pray tell me if it be necessary to write a little plainer; for I
looked over a bit of my last letter, and could hardly read
it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll mend my hand, if oo please: but you are more
used to it nor I, as Mr. Raymond says.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord Treasurer: this makes four
days together; and he has invited me again to-morrow, but I
absolutely refused him.&nbsp; I was this evening at a christening
with him of Lord Dupplin&rsquo;s <a name="citation499b"></a><a
href="#footnote499b" class="citation">[499b]</a> daughter.&nbsp;
He went away at ten; but they kept me and some others till past
twelve; so you may be sure &rsquo;tis late, as they say.&nbsp; We
have now stronger suspicions that the Duke d&rsquo;Aumont&rsquo;s
house was set on fire by malice.&nbsp; I was to-day to see Lord
Keeper, who has quite lost his voice with a cold.&nbsp; There Dr.
Radcliffe told me that it was the Ambassador&rsquo;s confectioner
set the house on fire by boiling sugar, and going down and
letting it boil over.&nbsp; Yet others still think differently;
so I know not what to judge.&nbsp; Nite my own deelest MD, rove
Pdfr.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; I was to-day at Court, where the Spanish Ambassador
talked to me as if he did not suspect any design in burning
d&rsquo;Aumont&rsquo;s house: but Abb&eacute; Gaultier, Secretary
for France here, said quite otherwise; and that d&rsquo;Aumont
had a letter the very same day to let him know his house should
be burnt, and they tell several other circumstances too tedious
to write.&nbsp; One is, that a fellow mending the tiles just when
the fire broke out, saw a pot with wildfire <a
name="citation499c"></a><a href="#footnote499c"
class="citation">[499c]</a> in the room.&nbsp; I <a
name="page500"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 500</span>dined with
Lord Orkney.&nbsp; Neither Lord Abercorn nor Selkirk will now
speak with me.&nbsp; I have disobliged both sides.&nbsp; Nite
dear MD.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; Our Society met to-day, fourteen of us, and at a
tavern.&nbsp; We now resolve to meet but once a fortnight, and
have a Committee every other week of six or seven, to consult
about doing some good.&nbsp; I proposed another message to Lord
Treasurer by three principal members, to give a hundred guineas
to a certain person, and they are to urge it as well as they
can.&nbsp; We also raised sixty guineas upon our own Society; but
I made them do it by sessors, <a name="citation500a"></a><a
href="#footnote500a" class="citation">[500a]</a> and I was one of
them, and we fitted our tax to the several estates.&nbsp; The
Duke of Ormond pays ten guineas, and I the third part of a
guinea; at that rate, they may tax as often as they please.&nbsp;
Well, but I must answer oor rettle, ung oomens: not yet;
&rsquo;tis rate now, and I can&rsquo;t tind it.&nbsp; Nite

<p>30.&nbsp; I have drank Spa waters this two or three days; but
they do not pass, and make me very giddy.&nbsp; I an&rsquo;t
well; faith, I&rsquo;ll take them no more.&nbsp; I sauntered
after church with the Provost to-day to see a library to be sold,
and dined at five with Lord Orkney.&nbsp; We still think there
was malice in burning d&rsquo;Aumont&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; I hear
little Harrison <a name="citation500b"></a><a
href="#footnote500b" class="citation">[500b]</a> is come over; it
was he I sent to Utrecht.&nbsp; He is now Queen&rsquo;s Secretary
to the Embassy, and has brought with him the Barrier Treaty, as
it is now corrected by us, and yielded to by the Dutch, which was
the greatest difficulty to retard the peace.&nbsp; I hope he will
bring over the peace a month hence, for we will send him back as
soon as possible.&nbsp; I long to see the little brat, my own
creature.&nbsp; His pay is in all a thousand pounds a year, and
they have never paid him a groat, though I have teased their
hearts out.&nbsp; He must be three or four hundred pounds in debt
at least, the brat!&nbsp; Let me go to bed, sollahs.&mdash;Nite
dee richar MD.</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; Harrison was with me this morning: we talked three
hours, and then I carried him to Court.&nbsp; When we went down
to the door of my lodging, I found a coach waited for <a
name="page501"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 501</span>him.&nbsp;
I chid him for it; but he whispered me it was impossible to do
otherwise; and in the coach he told me he had not one farthing in
his pocket to pay it; and therefore took the coach for the whole
day, and intended to borrow money somewhere or other.&nbsp; So
there was the Queen&rsquo;s Minister entrusted in affairs of the
greatest importance, without a shilling in his pocket to pay a
coach!&nbsp; I paid him while he was with me seven guineas, in
part of a dozen of shirts he bought me in Holland.&nbsp; I
presented him to the Duke of Ormond, and several lords at Court;
and I contrived it so that Lord Treasurer came to me and asked (I
had Parnell by me) whether that was Dr. Parnell, and came up and
spoke to him with great kindness, and invited him to his
house.&nbsp; I value myself upon making the Ministry desire to be
acquainted with Parnell, and not Parnell with the Ministry.&nbsp;
His poem is almost fully corrected, and shall soon be out.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s enough for to-day: only to tell you that I was in
the City with my printer to alter an <i>Examiner</i> about my
friend Lewis&rsquo;s story, <a name="citation501"></a><a
href="#footnote501" class="citation">[501]</a> which will be told
with remarks.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>Feb. 1.&nbsp; I could do nothing till to-day about the
<i>Examiner</i>, but the printer came this morning, and I
dictated to him what was fit to be said, and then Mr. Lewis came,
and corrected it as he would have it; so I was neither at church
nor Court.&nbsp; The Duke of Ormond and I dined at Lord
Orkney&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I left them at seven, and sat with Sir
Andrew Fountaine, who has a very bad sore leg, for which he
designs to go to France.&nbsp; Fais, here&rsquo;s a week gone,
and one side of this letter not finished.&nbsp; Oh, but I write
now but once in three weeks; iss, fais, this shall go
sooner.&nbsp; The Parliament is to sit on the third, but will
adjourn for three or four days; for the Queen is laid up with the
gout, and both Speakers out of order, though one of them, the
Lord Keeper, is almost well.&nbsp; I spoke to the Duke of Ormond
a good deal about Ireland.&nbsp; We do not altogether agree, nor
am I judge enough of Irish affairs; but I will speak to Lord
Treasurer <a name="page502"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
502</span>to-morrow, that we three may settle them some way or
other.&nbsp; Nite sollahs both, rove Pdfr.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I had a letter some days ago from Moll Gery; <a
name="citation502a"></a><a href="#footnote502a"
class="citation">[502a]</a> her name is now Wigmore, and her
husband has turned parson.&nbsp; She desires nothing but that I
would get Lord Keeper to give him a living; but I will send her
no answer, though she desires it much.&nbsp; She still makes
mantuas at Farnham.&nbsp; It rained all this day, and Dilly came
to me, and was coaching it into the City; so I went with him for
a shaking, because it would not cost me a farthing.&nbsp; There I
met my friend Stratford, <a name="citation502b"></a><a
href="#footnote502b" class="citation">[502b]</a> the merchant,
who is going abroad to gather up his debts, and be clear in the
world.&nbsp; He begged that I would dine with some merchant
friends of ours there, because it was the last time I should see
him: so I did, and thought to have seen Lord Treasurer in the
evening, but he happened to go out at five; so I visited some
friends, and came home.&nbsp; And now I have the greatest part of
your letter to answer; and yet I will not do it to-night, say
what oo please.&nbsp; The Parliament meets to-morrow, but will be
prorogued for a fortnight; which disappointment will, I believe,
vex abundance of them, though they are not Whigs; for they are
forced to be in town at expense for nothing: but we want an
answer from Spain, before we are sure of everything being right
for the peace; and God knows whether we can have that answer this
month.&nbsp; It is a most ticklish juncture of affairs; we are
always driving to an inch: I am weary of it.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Parliament met, and was prorogued, as I said, and
I found some cloudy faces, and heard some grumbling.&nbsp; We
have got over all our difficulties with France, I think.&nbsp;
They have now settled all the articles of commerce between us and
them, wherein they were very much disposed to play the rogue if
we had not held them to [it]; and this business we wait from
Spain is to prevent some other rogueries of the French, who are
finding an evasion to trade to the Spanish West Indies; but I
hope we shall prevent it.&nbsp; I dined with <a
name="page503"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 503</span>Lord
Treasurer, and he was in good humour enough.&nbsp; I gave him
that part of my book in manuscript to read where his character
was, and drawn pretty freely.&nbsp; He was reading and correcting
it with his pencil, when the Bishop of St. David&rsquo;s [<a
name="citation503a"></a><a href="#footnote503a"
class="citation">[503a]</a> (now removing to Hereford) came in
and interrupted us.&nbsp; I left him at eight, and sat till
twelve with the Provost and Bishop of Clogher at the
Provost&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I was to-day at Court, but kept out of Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s way, because I was engaged to the Duke of
Ormond, where I dined, and, I think, ate and drank too
much.&nbsp; I sat this evening with Lady Masham, and then with
Lord Masham and Lord Treasurer at Lord Masham&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It
was last year, you may remember, my constant evening place.&nbsp;
I saw Lady Jersey <a name="citation503b"></a><a
href="#footnote503b" class="citation">[503b]</a> with Lady
Masham, who has been laying out for my acquaintance, and has
forced a promise for me to drink chocolate with her in a day or
two, which I know not whether I shall perform (I have just mended
my pen, you see), for I do not much like her character; but she
is very malicious, and therefore I think I must keep fair with
her.&nbsp; I cannot send this letter till Saturday next, I find;
so I will answer oors now.&nbsp; I see no different days of the
month; yet it is dated January 3: so it was long a coming.&nbsp;
I did not write to Dr. Coghill that I would have nothing in
Ireland, but that I was soliciting nothing anywhere, and that is
true.&nbsp; I have named Dr. Sterne to Lord Treasurer, Lord
Bolingbroke, and the Duke of Ormond, for a bishopric, and I did
it heartily.&nbsp; I know not what will come of it; but I tell
you as a great secret that I have made the Duke of Ormond promise
me to recommend nobody till he tells me, and this for some
reasons too long to mention.&nbsp; My head is still in no good
order.&nbsp; I am heartily sorry for poo Ppt, I&rsquo;m
sure.&nbsp; Her head is good for . . . <a
name="citation503c"></a><a href="#footnote503c"

<p>5.&nbsp; I must go on with oo letter.&nbsp; I dined to-day
with Sir Andrew Fountaine and the Provost, and I played at ombre
<a name="page504"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 504</span>with him
all the afternoon.&nbsp; I won, yet Sir Andrew is an admirable
player.&nbsp; Lord Pembroke <a name="citation504a"></a><a
href="#footnote504a" class="citation">[504a]</a> came in, and I
gave him three or four scurvy Dilly puns, that begin with an
IF.&nbsp; Well, but oor letter, well, ret me see.&mdash;No; I
believe I shall write no more this good while, nor publish what I
have done.&nbsp; Nauty (?) Ppt, oo are vely tempegant.&nbsp; I
did not suspect oo would tell Filby. <a

visit as much for Mr. Walls.&nbsp; Pray God mend poopt&rsquo;s <a
name="citation504d"></a><a href="#footnote504d"

indifferent.&nbsp; I have left off Spa water; it makes my leg
swell.&nbsp; Nite deelest MD.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; This is the Queen&rsquo;s Birthday, and I never saw
it celebrated with so much luxury and fine clothes.&nbsp; I went
to Court to see them, and I dined with Lord Keeper, where the
ladies were fine to admiration.&nbsp; I passed the evening at
Mrs. Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s, and came home pretty early, to answer oo
rettle again.&nbsp; Pray God keep the Queen.&nbsp; She was very
ill about ten days ago, and had the gout in her stomach.&nbsp;
When I came from Lord Keeper&rsquo;s, I called at Lord
Treasurer&rsquo;s, because I heard he was very fine, and that was
a new thing; and it was true, for his coat and waistcoat were
embroidered.&nbsp; I have seen the Provost often since, and never
spoke to him to speak to the Temples about Daniel Carr, nor will;
I don&rsquo;t care to do it.&nbsp; I have writ lately to
Parvisol.&nbsp; Oo did well to let him make up his
accounts.&nbsp; All things grow dear in Ireland, but corn to the
parsons; for my livings are fallen much this year by
Parvisol&rsquo;s account.&nbsp; Nite dee logues, MD.</p>
<p>7. [8]&nbsp; I was at Court to-day, but saw no Birthday
clothes; the great folks never wear them above once or
twice.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Orkney, and sat the evening with
Sir Andrew Fountaine, whose leg is in a very dubious
condition.&nbsp; Pray let me know when DD&rsquo;s money is near
due: always let me know it beforehand.&nbsp; This, I believe,
will hardly go till Saturday; for I tell you what, being not very
well, I dare <a name="page505"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
505</span>not study much: so I let company come in a morning, and
the afternoon pass in dining and sitting somewhere.&nbsp; Lord
Treasurer is angry if I don&rsquo;t dine with him every second
day, and I cannot part with him till late: he kept me last night
till near twelve.&nbsp; Our weather is constant rain above these
two months, which hinders walking, so that our spring is not like
yours.&nbsp; I have not seen Fanny Manley <a
name="citation505a"></a><a href="#footnote505a"
class="citation">[505a]</a> yet; I cannot find time.&nbsp; I am
in rebellion with all my acquaintance, but I will mend with my
health and the weather.&nbsp; Clogher make a figure!&nbsp;
Clogher make a &mdash;.&nbsp; Colds! why, we have been all dying
with colds; but now they are a little over, and my second is
almost off.&nbsp; I can do nothing for Swanton indeed.&nbsp; It
is a thing impossible, and wholly out of my way.&nbsp; If he
buys, he must buy.&nbsp; So now I have answered oo rettle; and
there&rsquo;s an end of that now; and I&rsquo;ll say no more, but
bid oo nite, dee MD.</p>
<p>8. [9]&nbsp; It was terrible rainy to-day from morning till
night.&nbsp; I intended to have dined with Lord Treasurer, but
went to see Sir Andrew Fountaine, and he kept me to dinner, which
saved coach-hire; and I stayed with him all the afternoon, and
lost thirteen shillings and sixpence at ombre.&nbsp; There was
management! and Lord Treasurer will chide; but I&rsquo;ll dine
with him to-morrow.&nbsp; The Bishop of Clogher&rsquo;s daughter
has been ill some days, <a name="citation505b"></a><a
href="#footnote505b" class="citation">[505b]</a> and it proves
the smallpox.&nbsp; She is very full; but it comes out well, and
they apprehend no danger.&nbsp; Lady Orkney has given me her
picture; a very fine original of Sir Godfrey Kneller&rsquo;s; it
is now a mending.&nbsp; He has favoured her squint admirably; and
you know I love a cast in the eye.&nbsp; I was to see Lady
Worsley <a name="citation505c"></a><a href="#footnote505c"
class="citation">[505c]</a> to-day, who is just come to town; she
is full of rheumatic pains.&nbsp; All my acquaintance grow old
and sickly.&nbsp; She lodges in the very house in King Street,
between St. James&rsquo;s Street and St. James&rsquo;s Square,
where DD&rsquo;s brother bought the sweetbread, when I lodged
there, and MD came to see me.&nbsp; Short sighs. <a
name="citation505d"></a><a href="#footnote505d"
class="citation">[505d]</a>&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p><a name="page506"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 506</span>9.
[10]&nbsp; I thought to have dined with Lord Treasurer to-day,
but he dined abroad at Tom Harley&rsquo;s; so I dined at Lord
Masham&rsquo;s, and was winning all I had lost playing with Lady
Masham at crown picquet, when we went to pools, and I lost it
again.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer came in to us, and chid me for not
following him to Tom Harley&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Miss Ashe is still the
same, and they think her not in danger; my man calls there daily
after I am gone out, and tells me at night.&nbsp; I was this
morning to see Lady Jersey, and we have made twenty parties about
dining together, and I shall hardly keep one of them.&nbsp; She
is reduced after all her greatness to seven servants, and a small
house, and no coach. <a name="citation506a"></a><a
href="#footnote506a" class="citation">[506a]</a>&nbsp; I like her
tolerably as yet.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>10. [11]&nbsp; I made visits this morning to the Duke and
Duchess of Ormond, and Lady Betty, and the Duchess of
Hamilton.&nbsp; (When I was writing this near twelve
o&rsquo;clock, the Duchess of Hamilton sent to have me dine with
her to-morrow.&nbsp; I am forced to give my answer through the
door, for my man has got the key, and is gone to bed; but I
cannot obey her, for our Society meets to-morrow.)&nbsp; I stole
away from Lord Treasurer by eight, and intended to have passed
the evening with Sir Thomas Clarges <a name="citation506b"></a><a
href="#footnote506b" class="citation">[506b]</a> and his lady;
but met them in another place, and have there sat till now.&nbsp;
My head has not been ill to-day.&nbsp; I was at Court, and made
Lord Mansel walk with me in the Park before we went to
dinner.&mdash;Yesterday and to-day have been fair, but yet it
rained all last night.&nbsp; I saw Sterne staring at Court
to-day.&nbsp; He <a name="page507"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
507</span>has been often to see me, he says: but my man has not
yet let him up.&nbsp; He is in deep mourning; I hope it is not
for his wife. <a name="citation507a"></a><a href="#footnote507a"
class="citation">[507a]</a>&nbsp; I did not ask him.&nbsp; Nite
MD.</p>
<p>12. <a name="citation507b"></a><a href="#footnote507b"
class="citation">[507b]</a>&nbsp; I have reckoned days wrong all
this while; for this is the twelfth.&nbsp; I do not know when I
lost it.&nbsp; I dined to-day with our Society, the greatest
dinner I have ever seen.&nbsp; It was at Jack Hill&rsquo;s, the
Governor of Dunkirk.&nbsp; I gave an account of sixty guineas I
had collected, and am to give them away to two authors to-morrow;
and Lord Treasurer has promised us a hundred pounds to reward
some others.&nbsp; I found a letter on my table last night to
tell me that poor little Harrison, the Queen&rsquo;s Secretary,
that came lately from Utrecht with the Barrier Treaty, was ill,
and desired to see me at night; but it was late, and I could not
go till to-day.&nbsp; I have often mentioned him in my letters,
you may remember. . . . I went in the morning, and found him
mighty ill, and got thirty guineas for him from Lord Bolingbroke,
and an order for a hundred pounds from the Treasury to be paid
him to-morrow; and I have got him removed to Knightsbridge for
air.&nbsp; He has a fever and inflammation on his lungs; but I
hope will do well.&nbsp; Nite.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; I was to see a poor poet, one Mr. Diaper, <a
name="citation507c"></a><a href="#footnote507c"
class="citation">[507c]</a> in a nasty garret, very sick.&nbsp; I
gave him twenty guineas from Lord Bolingbroke, and disposed the
other sixty to two other authors, and desired a friend to receive
the hundred pounds for poor Harrison, and will carry it to him
to-morrow morning.&nbsp; I sent to see how he did, and he is
extremely ill; and I very much afflicted for him, for he is my
own creature, and in a very honourable post, and very worthy of
it.&nbsp; I dined in the City.&nbsp; I am in much concern for
this poor lad.&nbsp; His mother and sister attend him, and he
wants nothing.&nbsp; Nite poo dee MD.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; I took Parnell this morning, and we walked to see <a
name="page508"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 508</span>poor
Harrison.&nbsp; I had the hundred pounds in my pocket.&nbsp; I
told Parnell I was afraid to knock at the door; my mind misgave
me.&nbsp; I knocked, and his man in tears told me his master was
dead an hour before.&nbsp; Think what grief this is to me!&nbsp;
I went to his mother, and have been ordering things for his
funeral with as little cost as possible, to-morrow at ten at
night.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer was much concerned when I told
him.&nbsp; I could not dine with Lord Treasurer, nor anywhere
else; but got a bit of meat toward evening.&nbsp; No loss ever
grieved me so much: poor creature!&nbsp; Pray God Almighty bless
poor MD.&nbsp; Adieu.</p>
<p>I send this away to-night, and am sorry it must go while I am
in so much grief.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>Feb.</i> 15 [1712&ndash;13].</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">dined</span> to-day with Mr. Rowe <a

class="citation">[508b]</a> and a projector, who has been teasing
me with twenty schemes to get grants; and I don&rsquo;t like one
of them; and, besides, I was out of humour for the loss of poor
Harrison.&nbsp; At ten this night I was at his funeral, which I
ordered to be as private as possible.&nbsp; We had but one coach
with four of us; and when it was carrying us home after the
funeral, the braces broke; and we were forced to sit in it, and
have it held up, till my man went for chairs, <a

<p>16.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord Dupplin and some company to
divert me; but left them early, and have been reading a foolish
book for amusement.&nbsp; I shall never have courage again to
care for making anybody&rsquo;s fortune.&nbsp; The Parliament
meets to-morrow, and will be prorogued another fortnight, at
which several of both parties were angry; but it cannot be <a
name="page509"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 509</span>helped,
though everything about the peace is past all danger.&nbsp; I
never saw such a continuance of rainy weather.&nbsp; We have not
had two fair days together these ten weeks.&nbsp; I have not
dined with Lord Treasurer these four days, nor can I till
Saturday; for I have several engagements till then, and he will
chide me to some purpose.&nbsp; I am perplexed with this hundred
pounds of poor Harrison&rsquo;s, what to do with it.&nbsp; I
cannot pay his relations till they administer, for he is much in
debt; <a name="citation509a"></a><a href="#footnote509a"

hands, and venture nothing.&nbsp; Nite poo dee MD.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; Lady Jersey and I dined by appointment to-day with
Lord Bolingbroke.&nbsp; He is sending his brother <a

class="citation">[509b]</a> to succeed Mr. <a
name="citation509c"></a><a href="#footnote509c"

post in Europe for a young gentleman.&nbsp; I lose my money at
ombre sadly; I make a thousand blunders.&nbsp; I play but <a
name="citation509d"></a><a href="#footnote509d"
class="citation">[509d]</a> threepenny ombre; but it is what you
call running ombre.&nbsp; Lady Clarges, <a
name="citation509e"></a><a href="#footnote509e"
class="citation">[509e]</a> and a drab I hate, won a dozen
shillings of me last night.&nbsp; The Parliament was prorogued
to-day; and people grumble; and the good of it is the peace
cannot be finished by the time they meet, there are so many
fiddling things to do.&nbsp; Is Ppt an ombre lady yet?&nbsp; You
know all the tricks of it now, I suppose.&nbsp; I reckon you have
all your cards from France, for ours pay sixpence a pack taxes,
which goes deep to the box.&nbsp; I have given away all my Spa
water, and take some nasty steel drops, and my head has been
better this week past.&nbsp; I send every day to see how Miss
Ashe does: she is very full, they say, but in no danger.&nbsp; I
fear she will lose some of her beauty.&nbsp; The son lies out of
the house.&nbsp; I wish he had them too, while he is so
young.&mdash;Nite MD.</p>

name="citation510a"></a><a href="#footnote510a"
class="citation">[510a]</a> has been teasing me these three
months to dine with him; and this day was appointed about a week
ago, and I named my company; Lord Stawel, <a

class="citation">[510b]</a> Colonel Disney, <a
name="citation510c"></a><a href="#footnote510c"
class="citation">[510c]</a> and Dr. Arbuthnot; but the two last
slipped out their necks, and left Stawell and me to dine
there.&nbsp; We did not dine till seven, because it is Ash
Wednesday.&nbsp; We had nothing but fish, which Lord Stawell
could not eat, and got a broiled leg of a turkey.&nbsp; Our wine
was poison; yet the puppy has twelve thousand pound a year.&nbsp;
His carps were raw, and his candles tallow.&nbsp; He <a
name="citation510d"></a><a href="#footnote510d"
class="citation">[510d]</a> shall not catch me in haste again,
and everybody has laughed at me for dining with him.&nbsp; I was
to-day to let Harrison&rsquo;s mother know I could not pay till
she administers; which she will do.&nbsp; I believe she is an old
bawd, <a name="citation510e"></a><a href="#footnote510e"

There were more Whigs to-day at Court than Tories.&nbsp; I
believe they think the peace must be made, and so come to please
the Queen.&nbsp; She is still lame with the gout.&nbsp; Nite

<p>19.&nbsp; I was at Court to-day, to speak to Lord Bolingbroke
to look over Parnell&rsquo;s poem since it is corrected; and
Parnell and I dined with him, and he has shown him three or four
more places to alter a little.&nbsp; Lady Bolingbroke came down
to us while we were at dinner, and Parnell stared at her as if
she were a goddess.&nbsp; I thought she was like Parnell&rsquo;s
wife, and he thought so too.&nbsp; Parnell is much pleased with
Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s favour to him, and I hope it may one day
turn to his advantage.&nbsp; His poem will be printed in a few
days.&nbsp; Our weather continues as fresh raining as if it had
not rained at all.&nbsp; I sat to-night at Lady Masham&rsquo;s,
where Lord Treasurer came and scolded me for not dining with
him.&nbsp; I told him I could not till Saturday.&nbsp; I have
stayed there till past twelve.&nbsp; So nite dee sollahs,

class="citation">[511b]</a> another Spaniard, and I, dined to-day
by appointment with Lord Bolingbroke; but they fell a drinking so
many Spanish healths in champagne that I stole away to the
ladies, and drank tea till eight; and then went and lost my money
at ombre with Sir Andrew Fountaine, who has a very bad leg.&nbsp;
Miss Ashe is past all danger; and her eye, which was lately bad
(I suppose one effect of her distemper), is now better.&nbsp; I
do not let the Bishop see me, nor shall this good while.&nbsp;
Good luck! when I came home, I warrant, I found a letter from MD,
No.38; and oo write so small nowadays, I hope oo poor eyes are
better.&nbsp; Well, this shall go to-morrow se&rsquo;nnight, with
a bill for MD.&nbsp; I will speak to Mr. Griffin <a
name="citation511c"></a><a href="#footnote511c"
class="citation">[511c]</a> to-morrow about Ppt&rsquo;s brother
Filby, and desire, whether he deserves or no, that his employment
may be mended; that is to say, if I can see Griffin; otherwise
not; and I&rsquo;ll answer oo rettle hen I Pdfr think fit.&nbsp;

<p>21.&nbsp; Methinks I writ a little saucy last night.&nbsp; I
mean the last . . . <a name="citation511d"></a><a
href="#footnote511d" class="citation">[511d]</a> I saw Griffin at
Court.&nbsp; He says he knows nothing of a salt-work at Recton;
but that he will give Filby a better employment, and desires
Filby will write to him.&nbsp; If I knew how to write to Filby, I
would; but pray do you.&nbsp; Bid him make no mention of you; but
only let Mr. Griffin know that he has the honour to be
recommended by Dr. S&mdash;, etc.; that he will endeavour to
deserve, etc.; and if you dictated a whole letter for him, it
would be better; I hope he can write and spell well.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll inquire for a direction to Griffin before I finish
this.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Treasurer and seven lords
to-day.&nbsp; You know Saturday is his great day, but I sat with
them alone till eight, and then came home, and have been writing
a letter to Mrs. Davis, at York.&nbsp; She took care to have a
letter delivered for me at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s; <a
name="page512"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 512</span>for I would
not own one she sent by post.&nbsp; She reproaches me for not
writing to her these four years; and I have honestly told her it
was my way never to write to those whom I am never likely to see,
unless I can serve them, which I cannot her, etc.&nbsp; Davis the
schoolmaster&rsquo;s widow.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Lord Orkney&rsquo;s, with the Duke
of Ormond and Sir Thomas Hanmer. <a name="citation512"></a><a
href="#footnote512" class="citation">[512]</a>&nbsp; Have you
ever heard of the latter?&nbsp; He married the Duchess of Grafton
in his youth (she dined with us too).&nbsp; He is the most
considerable man in the House of Commons.&nbsp; He went last
spring to Flanders, with the Duke of Ormond; from thence to
France, and was going to Italy; but the Ministry sent for him,
and he has been come over about ten days.&nbsp; He is much out of
humour with things: he thinks the peace is kept off too long, and
is full of fears and doubts.&nbsp; It is thought he is designed
for Secretary of State, instead of Lord Dartmouth.&nbsp; We have
been acquainted these two years; and I intend, in a day or two,
to have an hour&rsquo;s talk with him on affairs.&nbsp; I saw the
Bishop of Clogher at Court; Miss is recovering.&nbsp; I know not
how much she will be marked.&nbsp; The Queen is slowly mending of
her gout, and intends to be brought in a chair to Parliament when
it meets, which will be March 3; for I suppose they will prorogue
no more; yet the peace will not be signed then, and we apprehend
the Tories themselves will many of them be discontented.&nbsp;
Nite dee MD.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; It was ill weather to-day, and I dined with Sir
Andrew Fountaine, and in the evening played at ombre with him and
the Provost, and won twenty-five shillings; so I have recovered
myself pretty well.&nbsp; Dilly has been dunning me to see Fanny
Manley; but I have not yet been able to do it.&nbsp; Miss Ashe is
now quite out of danger; and hope will not be <a
name="page513"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 513</span>much
marked.&nbsp; I cannot tell how to direct to Griffin; and think
he lives in Bury Street, near St. James&rsquo;s Street, hard by
me; but I suppose your brother may direct to him to the Salt
Office, and, as I remember, he knows his Christian name, because
he sent it me in the list of the Commissioners.&nbsp; Nite dee

<p>24.&nbsp; I walked this morning to Chelsea, to see Dr.
Atterbury, Dean of Christ Church.&nbsp; I had business with him
about entering Mr. Fitzmaurice, <a name="citation513a"></a><a
href="#footnote513a" class="citation">[513a]</a> my Lord
Kerry&rsquo;s son, into his College; and Lady Kerry <a

Lord Harley, Lord Dupplin, young Bromley <a

with Dr. Stratford <a name="citation513d"></a><a
href="#footnote513d" class="citation">[513d]</a> and some other
clergymen; but I left them at seven to go to Lady Jersey, to see
Monteleon the Spanish Ambassador play at ombre.&nbsp; Lady Jersey
was abroad, and I chid the servants, and made a rattle; but since
I came home she sent me a message that I was mistaken, and that
the meeting is to be to-morrow.&nbsp; I have a worse memory than
when I left you, and every day forget appointments; but here my
memory was by chance too good.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll go to-morrow;
for Lady Catherine Hyde and Lady Bolingbroke are to be there by
appointment, and I listed <a name="citation513e"></a><a

and all, to make a figure.&nbsp; Well, who can help it?&nbsp; Not

<p>25.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer met me last night at Lord
Masham&rsquo;s, and thanked me for my company in a jeer, because
I had not dined with him in three days.&nbsp; He chides me if I
stay away but two days together.&nbsp; What will this come
to?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; My grandmother used to say, &ldquo;More
of your <a name="page514"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
514</span>lining, and less of your dining.&rdquo;&nbsp; However,
I dined with him, and could hardly leave him at eight, to go to
Lady Jersey&rsquo;s, where five or six foreign Ministers were,
and as many ladies.&nbsp; Monteleon played like the English, and
cried &ldquo;gacco,&rdquo; and knocked his knuckles for trump,
and played at small games like Ppt.&nbsp; Lady Jersey whispered
me to stay and sup with the ladies when the fellows were gone;
but they played till eleven, and I would not stay.&nbsp; I think
this letter must go on Saturday; that&rsquo;s certain; and it is
not half full yet.&nbsp; Lady Catherine Hyde had a mighty mind I
should be acquainted with Lady Dalkeith, <a
name="citation514a"></a><a href="#footnote514a"
class="citation">[514a]</a> her sister, the Duke of
Monmouth&rsquo;s eldest son&rsquo;s widow, who was of the company
to-night; but I did not like her; she paints too much.&nbsp; Nite
MD.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; This day our Society met at the Duke of
Ormond&rsquo;s, but I had business that called me another way; so
I sent my excuses, and dined privately with a friend.&nbsp;
Besides, Sir Thomas Hanmer whispered me last night at Lady
Jersey&rsquo;s that I must attend Lord Treasurer and Duke of
Ormond at supper at his house to-night; which I did at eleven,
and stayed till one, so oo may be sure &rsquo;tis late
enough.&nbsp; There was the Duchess of Grafton, and the Duke her
son; nine of us in all.&nbsp; The Duke of Ormond chid me for not
being at the Society to-day, and said sixteen were there.&nbsp; I
said I never knew sixteen people good company in my life; no,
fais, nor eight either.&nbsp; We have no news in this town at
all.&nbsp; I wonder why I don&rsquo;t write you news.&nbsp; I
know less of what passes than anybody, because I go to <a
name="citation514b"></a><a href="#footnote514b"
class="citation">[514b]</a> no coffee-house, nor see any but
Ministers, and such people; and Ministers never talk politics in
conversation.&nbsp; The Whigs are forming great schemes against
the meeting of Parliament, which will be next Tuesday, I still
think, without fail; and we hope to hear <a
name="page515"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 515</span>by then
that the peace is ready to sign.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s gout
mends daily.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; I passed a very insipid day, and dined privately
with a friend in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Did I tell you that I
have a very fine picture of Lady Orkney, <a
name="citation515a"></a><a href="#footnote515a"
class="citation">[515a]</a> an original, by Sir Godfrey Kneller,
three-quarters length?&nbsp; I have it now at home, with a fine
frame.&nbsp; Lord Bolingbroke and Lady Masham have promised to
sit for me; but I despair of Lord Treasurer; only I hope he will
give me a copy, and then I shall have all the pictures of those I
really love here; just half a dozen; only I&rsquo;ll make Lord
Keeper give me his print in a frame.&nbsp; This letter must go
to-morrow, because of sending ME a bill; else it should not till
next week, I assure oo.&nbsp; I have little to do now with my
pen; for my grand business stops till they are more pressing, and
till something or other happens; and I believe I shall return
with disgust to finish it, it is so very laborious.&nbsp; Sir
Thomas Hanmer has my papers now.&nbsp; And hat is MD doing
now?&nbsp; Oh, at ombre with the Dean always on Friday night,
with Mrs. Walls.&nbsp; Pray don&rsquo;t play at small
games.&nbsp; I stood by, t&rsquo;other night, while the Duke
d&rsquo;Atree <a name="citation515b"></a><a href="#footnote515b"
class="citation">[515b]</a> lost six times with manilio, basto,
and three small trumps; and Lady Jersey won above twenty

<p>28.&nbsp; I was at Court to-day, when the Abb&eacute; Gaultier
whispered me that a courier was just come with an account that
the French King had consented to all the Queen&rsquo;s demands,
and his consent was carried to Utrecht, and the peace will be
signed in a few days.&nbsp; I suppose the general peace cannot be
so soon ready; but that is no matter.&nbsp; The news presently
ran about the Court.&nbsp; I saw the Queen carried out in her
chair, to take the air in the garden.&nbsp; I met Griffin at
Court, and he told me that orders were sent to examine Filby;
and, if he be fit, to make him (I think he called it) an
assistant; I don&rsquo;t know what, Supervisor, I think; but it
is some employment a good deal better than his own.&nbsp; The
Parliament will have another <a name="page516"></a><span

known yet.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Treasurer and his Saturday

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>March</i> 1, 1712&ndash;13.</p>
<p>&rsquo;<span class="smcap">Tis</span> out of my head whether I
answered all your letter in my last yesterday or no.&nbsp; I
think I was in haste, and could not: but now I see I answered a
good deal of it; no, only about your brother, and ME&rsquo;s
bill.&nbsp; I dined with Lady Orkney, and we talked politics till
eleven at night; and, as usual, found everything wrong, and put
ourselves out of humour.&nbsp; Yes, I have Lady Giffard&rsquo;s
picture sent me by your mother.&nbsp; It is boxed up at a place
where my other things are.&nbsp; I have goods in two or three
places; and when I leave a lodging, I box up the books I get (for
I always get some), and come naked into a new lodging; and so
on.&nbsp; Talk not to me of deaneries; I know less of that than
ever by much.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I went to-day into the City to see Pat Rolt, <a
name="citation516b"></a><a href="#footnote516b"
class="citation">[516b]</a> who lodges with a City cousin, a
daughter of coz Cleve; (you are much the wiser).&nbsp; I had
never been at her house before.&nbsp; My he-coz Thompson the
butcher is dead, or dying.&nbsp; I dined with my printer, and
walked home, and went to sit with Lady Clarges.&nbsp; I found
four of them at whist; Lady Godolphin <a
name="citation516c"></a><a href="#footnote516c"
class="citation">[516c]</a> was one.&nbsp; I sat by her, and
talked of her cards, etc., but she would not give me one look,
nor say a word to me.&nbsp; She refused some time ago to be
acquainted with me.&nbsp; You know she is Lord
Marlborough&rsquo;s eldest daughter.&nbsp; She is a fool for her
pains, and I&rsquo;ll pull her down.&nbsp; What can I do <a
name="page517"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 517</span>for Dr.
Smith&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s husband?&nbsp; I have no personal
credit with any of the Commissioners.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll speak to
Keatley; <a name="citation517a"></a><a href="#footnote517a"
class="citation">[517a]</a> but I believe it will signify
nothing.&nbsp; In the Customs people must rise by degrees, and he
must at first take what is very low, if he be qualified for
that.&nbsp; Ppt mistakes me; I am not angry at your recommending
anyone to me, provided you will take my answer.&nbsp; Some things
are in my way, and then I serve those I can.&nbsp; But people
will not distinguish, but take things ill, when I have no power;
but Ppt is wiser.&nbsp; And employments in general are very hard
to be got.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord Treasurer, who chid me for
my absence, which was only from Saturday last.&nbsp; The
Parliament was again prorogued for a week, and I suppose the
peace will be ready by then, and the Queen will be able to be
brought to the House, and make her speech.&nbsp; I saw Dr.
Griffith <a name="citation517b"></a><a href="#footnote517b"
class="citation">[517b]</a> two or three months ago, at a Latin
play at Westminster; but did not speak to him.&nbsp; I hope he
will not die; I should be sorry for Ppt&rsquo;s sake; he is very
tender of her.&nbsp; I have long lost all my colds, and the
weather mends a little.&nbsp; I take some steel drops, and my
head is pretty well.&nbsp; I walk when I can, but am grown very
idle; and, not finishing my thing, I gamble <a
name="citation517c"></a><a href="#footnote517c"
class="citation">[517c]</a> abroad and play at ombre.&nbsp; I
shall be more careful in my physic than Mrs. Price: &rsquo;tis
not a farthing matter her death, I think; and so I say no more
to-night, but will read a dull book, and go sleep.&nbsp; Nite dee
MD.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Mr. Ford has been this half-year inviting me to dine
at his lodgings: so I did to-day, and brought the Provost and Dr.
Parnell with me, and my friend Lewis was there.&nbsp; Parnell
went away, and the other three played at ombre, and I looked on;
which I love, and would not play.&nbsp; Tisdall is a pretty
fellow, as you say; and when I come back to Ireland with nothing,
he will condole with me with abundance of secret pleasure.&nbsp;
I believe I told you what he wrote to me, that I have saved
England, and he Ireland; <a name="citation517d"></a><a
href="#footnote517d" class="citation">[517d]</a> but <a
name="page518"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 518</span>I can bear
that.&nbsp; I have learned to hear and see, and say
nothing.&nbsp; I was to see the Duchess of Hamilton to-day, and
met Blith <a name="citation518a"></a><a href="#footnote518a"
class="citation">[518a]</a> of Ireland just going out of her
house into his coach.&nbsp; I asked her how she came to receive
young fellows.&nbsp; It seems he had a ball in the Duke of
Hamilton&rsquo;s house when the Duke died; and the Duchess got an
advertisement put in the <i>Postboy</i>, <a
name="citation518b"></a><a href="#footnote518b"
class="citation">[518b]</a> reflecting on the ball, because the
Marlborough daughters <a name="citation518c"></a><a
href="#footnote518c" class="citation">[518c]</a> were there; and
Blith came to beg the Duchess&rsquo;s pardon, and clear
himself.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a sad dog.&nbsp; Nite poo dee deelest
MD.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Lady Masham has miscarried; but is well almost
again.&nbsp; I have many visits to-day.&nbsp; I met Blith at the
Duke of Ormond&rsquo;s; and he begged me to carry him to the
Duchess of Hamilton, to beg her pardon again.&nbsp; I did on
purpose to see how the blunderbuss behaved himself; but I begged
the Duchess to use him mercifully, for she is the devil of a
teaser.&nbsp; The good of it is, she ought to beg his pardon, for
he meant no harm; yet she would not allow him to put in an
advertisement to clear himself from hers, though hers was all a
lie.&nbsp; He appealed to me, and I gravely gave it against
him.&nbsp; I was at Court to-day, and the foreign Ministers have
got a trick of employing me to speak for them to Lord Treasurer
and Lord Bolingbroke; which I do when the case is
reasonable.&nbsp; The College <a name="citation518d"></a><a
href="#footnote518d" class="citation">[518d]</a> need not fear; I
will not be their Governor.&nbsp; I dined with Sir Thomas Hanmer
and his Duchess. <a name="citation518e"></a><a
href="#footnote518e" class="citation">[518e]</a>&nbsp; The Duke
of Ormond was there, but we parted soon, and I went to visit Lord
Pembroke for the first time; but it was to see some curious
books.&nbsp; Lord Cholmondeley <a name="citation518f"></a><a
href="#footnote518f" class="citation">[518f]</a> came in; but I
would not talk to him, though he made many advances.&nbsp; I hate
the scoundrel for all he is your Griffith&rsquo;s
friend.&mdash;Yes, yes, I am abused enough, if that be all.&nbsp;
Nite sollahs.</p>
<p><a name="page519"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
519</span>6.&nbsp; I was to-day at an auction of pictures with
Pratt, <a name="citation519a"></a><a href="#footnote519a"
class="citation">[519a]</a> and laid out two pound five shillings
for a picture of Titian, and if it were a Titian it would be
worth twice as many pounds.&nbsp; If I am cheated, I&rsquo;ll
part with it to Lord Masham: if it be a bargain, I&rsquo;ll keep
it to myself.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my conscience.&nbsp; But I made
Pratt buy several pictures for Lord Masham.&nbsp; Pratt is a
great virtuoso that way.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Treasurer, but
made him go to Court at eight.&nbsp; I always tease him to be
gone.&nbsp; I thought to have made Parnell dine with him, but he
was ill; his head is out of order like mine, but more constant,
poor boy!&mdash;I was at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s levee with the
Provost, to ask a book for the College.&mdash;I never go to his
levee, unless to present somebody.&nbsp; For all oor rallying,
saucy <a name="citation519b"></a><a href="#footnote519b"
class="citation">[519b]</a> Ppt, as hope saved, I expected they
would have decided about me long ago; and as hope saved, as soon
as ever things are given away and I not provided for, I will be
gone with the very first opportunity, and put up bag and
baggage.&nbsp; But people are slower than can be thought.&nbsp;
Nite MD.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Yes, I hope Leigh will soon be gone, a p&mdash; on
him!&nbsp; I met him once, and he talked gravely to me of not
seeing the Irish bishops here, and the Irish gentlemen; but I
believe my answers fretted him enough.&nbsp; I would not dine
with Lord Treasurer to-day, though it was Saturday (for he has
engaged me for to-morrow), but went and dined with Lord Masham,
and played at ombre, sixpenny running ombre, for three
hours.&nbsp; There were three voles <a name="citation519c"></a><a
href="#footnote519c" class="citation">[519c]</a> against me, and
I was once a great loser, but came off for three shillings and
sixpence.&nbsp; One may easily lose five guineas at it.&nbsp;
Lady Orkney is gone out of town to-day, and I could not see her
for laziness, but writ to her.&nbsp; She has left me some
physic.&nbsp; Fais, I never knew MD&rsquo;s politics before, and
I think it pretty extraordinary, and a great compliment to you,
and I believe never three people conversed so much with so little
politics.&nbsp; I avoid all conversation with the other party; it
is not to be borne, and I am sorry for it.&nbsp; O yes, things
[are] very dear.&nbsp; <a name="page520"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 520</span>DD must come in at last with
DD&rsquo;s two eggs a penny.&nbsp; There the proverb was well
applied.&nbsp; Parvisol has sent me a bill of fifty pounds, as I
ordered him, which, I hope, will serve me, and bring me
over.&nbsp; Pray God MD does not be delayed for it; but I have
had very little from him this long time.&nbsp; I was not at Court
to-day; a wonder!&nbsp; Nite sollahs . . . Pdfr.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Oo must know, I give chocolate almost every day to
two or three people that I suffer to come to see me in a
morning.&nbsp; My man begins to lie pretty well.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
nothing for people to be denied ten times.&nbsp; My man knows all
I will see, and denies me to everybody else.&nbsp; This is the
day of the Queen&rsquo;s coming to the Crown, and the day Lord
Treasurer was stabbed by Guiscard.&nbsp; I was at Court, where
everybody had their Birthday clothes on, and I dined with Lord
Treasurer, who was very fine.&nbsp; He showed me some of the
Queen&rsquo;s speech, which I corrected in several places, and
penned the vote of address of thanks for the speech; but I was of
opinion the House should not sit on Tuesday next, unless they
hear the peace is signed; that is, provided they are sure it will
be signed the week after, and so have one scolding for all.&nbsp;
Nite MD.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer would have had me dine with him
to-day; he desired me last night, but I refused, because he would
not keep the day of his stabbing with all the Cabinet, as he
intended: so I dined with my friend Lewis; and the Provost and
Parnell, and Ford, was with us.&nbsp; I lost sixteen shillings at
ombre; I don&rsquo;t like it, as etc.&nbsp; At night Lewis
brought us word that the Parliament does not sit to-morrow.&nbsp;
I hope they are sure of the peace by next week, and then they are
right in my opinion: otherwise I think they have done wrong, and
might have sat three weeks ago.&nbsp; People will grumble; but
Lord Treasurer cares not a rush.&nbsp; Lord Keeper is suddenly
taken ill of a quinsy, and some lords are commissioned, I think
Lord Trevor, <a name="citation520"></a><a href="#footnote520"
class="citation">[520]</a> to prorogue the Parliament <a
name="page521"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 521</span>in his
stead.&nbsp; You never saw a town so full of ferment and
expectation.&nbsp; Mr. Pope has published a fine poem, called
<i>Windsor Forest</i>. <a name="citation521a"></a><a

<p>10.&nbsp; I was early this morning to see Lord
Bolingbroke.&nbsp; I find he was of opinion the Parliament should
sit; and says they are not sure the peace will be signed next
week.&nbsp; The prorogation is to this day se&rsquo;nnight.&nbsp;
I went to look on a library I am going to buy, if we can
agree.&nbsp; I have offered a hundred and twenty pounds, and will
give ten more.&nbsp; Lord Bolingbroke will lend me the
money.&nbsp; I was two hours poring on the books.&nbsp; I will
sell some of them, and keep the rest; but I doubt they
won&rsquo;t take the money.&nbsp; I dined in the City, and sat an
hour in the evening with Lord Treasurer, who was in very good
humour; but reproached me for not dining with him yesterday and
to-day.&nbsp; What will all this come to?&nbsp; Lord Keeper had a
pretty good night, and is better.&nbsp; I was in pain for
him.&nbsp; How do oo do sollahs? . . . Nite MD. <a

class="citation">[521b]</a></p>
<p>11.&nbsp; I was this morning to visit the Duke and Duchess of
Ormond, and the Duchess of Hamilton, and went with the Provost to
an auction of pictures, and laid out fourteen shillings.&nbsp; I
am in for it, if I had money; but I doubt I shall be undone; for
Sir Andrew Fountaine invited the Provost and me to dine with him,
and play at ombre, when I fairly lost fourteen shillings.&nbsp;
Fais, it won&rsquo;t do; and I shall be out of conceit with play
this good while.&nbsp; I am come home; and it is late, and my
puppy let out my fire, and I am gone to bed and writing there,
and it is past twelve a good while.&nbsp; Went out four matadores
and a trump in black, and was bested.&nbsp; Vely bad, fais! Nite
my deelest logues MD.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; I was at another auction of pictures to-day, and a
great auction it was.&nbsp; I made Lord Masham lay out forty <a
name="page522"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
522</span>pounds.&nbsp; There were pictures sold of twice as much
value apiece.&nbsp; Our Society met to-day at the Duke of
Beaufort&rsquo;s: a prodigious fine dinner, which I hate; but we
did some business.&nbsp; Our printer was to attend us, as usual;
and the Chancellor of the Exchequer sent the author of the
<i>Examiner</i> <a name="citation522a"></a><a
href="#footnote522a" class="citation">[522a]</a> twenty
guineas.&nbsp; He is an ingenious fellow, but the most confounded
vain coxcomb in the world, so that I dare not let him see me, nor
am acquainted with him.&nbsp; I had much discourse with the Duke
of Ormond this morning, and am driving some points to secure us
all in case of accidents, etc. <a name="citation522b"></a><a
href="#footnote522b" class="citation">[522b]</a>&nbsp; I left the
Society at seven.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t drink now at all with any
pleasure.&nbsp; I love white Portugal wine better than claret,
champagne, or burgundy.&nbsp; I have a sad vulgar appetite.&nbsp;
I remember Ppt used to maunder, when I came from a great dinner,
and DD had but a bit of mutton.&nbsp; I cannot endure above one
dish; nor ever could since I was a boy, and loved stuffing.&nbsp;
It was a fine day, which is a rarity with us, I assure
[you].&nbsp; Never fair two days together.&nbsp; Nite dee MD.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; I had a rabble of Irish parsons this morning
drinking my chocolate.&nbsp; I cannot remember
appointments.&nbsp; I was to have supped last night with the
Swedish Envoy at his house, and some other company, but forgot
it; and he rallied me to-day at Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s, who
excused me, saying, the Envoy ought not to be angry, because I
serve Lord Treasurer and him the same way.&nbsp; For that reason,
I very seldom promise to go anywhere.&nbsp; I dined with Lord
Treasurer, who chid me for being absent so long, as he always
does if I miss a day.&nbsp; I sat three hours this evening with
Lady Jersey; but the first two hours she was at ombre with some
company.&nbsp; I left Lord Treasurer at eight: I fancied he was a
little thoughtful, for he was playing with an orange by fits,
which, I told him, among common men looked like the spleen.&nbsp;
This letter shall not go to-morrow; no haste, ung oomens; <a
name="page523"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 523</span>nothing
that presses.&nbsp; I promised but once in three weeks, and I am
better than my word.&nbsp; I wish the peace may be ready, I mean
that we have notice it is signed, before Tuesday; otherwise the
grumbling will much increase.&nbsp; Nite logues.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; It was a lovely day this, and I took the advantage
of walking a good deal in the Park, before I went to Court.&nbsp;
Colonel Disney, one of our Society, is ill of a fever, and, we
fear, in great danger.&nbsp; We all love him mightily, and he
would be a great loss.&nbsp; I doubt I shall not buy the library;
for a roguey bookseller has offered sixty pounds more than I
designed to give; so you see I meant to have a good
bargain.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Treasurer and his Saturday
company; but there were but seven at table.&nbsp; Lord
Peterborrow is ill, and spits blood, with a bruise he got before
he left England; but, I believe, an Italian lady he has brought
over is the cause that his illness returns.&nbsp; You know old
Lady Bellasis <a name="citation523a"></a><a href="#footnote523a"
class="citation">[523a]</a> is dead at last?&nbsp; She has left
Lord Berkeley of Stratton <a name="citation523b"></a><a
href="#footnote523b" class="citation">[523b]</a> one of her
executors, and it will be of great advantage to him; they say
above ten thousand pounds.&nbsp; I stayed with Lord Treasurer
upon business, after the company was gone; but I dare not tell
you upon what.&nbsp; My letters would be good memoirs, if I durst
venture to say a thousand things that pass; but I hear so much of
letters opening at your post-office that I am fearful, etc., and
so good-nite, sollahs, rove Pdfr, MD.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer engaged me to dine with him again
to-day, and I had ready what he wanted; but he would not see it,
but put me off till to-morrow.&nbsp; The Queen goes to chapel
now.&nbsp; She is carried in an open chair, and will be well
enough to go to Parliament on Tuesday, if the Houses meet, which
is not yet certain; neither, indeed, can the <a
name="page524"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 524</span>Ministers
themselves tell; for it depends on winds and weather, and
circumstances of negotiation.&nbsp; However, we go on as if it
was certainly to meet; and I am to be at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s
to-morrow, upon that supposition, to settle some things relating
that way.&nbsp; Ppt <a name="citation524a"></a><a
href="#footnote524a" class="citation">[524a]</a> may understand
me.&nbsp; The doctors tell me that if poor Colonel Disney does
not get some sleep to-night, he must die.&nbsp; What care
you?&nbsp; Ah! but I do care.&nbsp; He is one of our Society; a
fellow of abundance of humour; an old battered rake, but very
honest, not an old man, but an old rake.&nbsp; It was he that
said of Jenny Kingdom, <a name="citation524b"></a><a
href="#footnote524b" class="citation">[524b]</a> the maid of
honour, who is a little old, that, since she could not get a
husband, the Queen should give her a brevet to act as a married
woman.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t understand this.&nbsp; They give
brevets to majors and captains to act as colonels in the
army.&nbsp; Brevets are commissions.&nbsp; Ask soldiers, dull
sollahs.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; I was at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s before he came; and,
as he entered, he told me the Parliament was prorogued till
Thursday se&rsquo;nnight.&nbsp; They have had some expresses, by
which they count that the peace may be signed by that time; at
least, that France, Holland, and we, will sign some articles, by
which we shall engage to sign the peace when it is ready: but
Spain has no Minister there; for Monteleon, who is to be their
Ambassador at Utrecht, is not yet gone from hence; and till he is
there, the Spaniards can sign no peace: and [of] one thing take
notice, that a general peace can hardly be finished these two
months, so as to be proclaimed here; for, after signing, it must
be ratified; that is, confirmed by the several princes at their
Courts, which to Spain will cost a month; for we must have notice
that it is ratified in all Courts before we can proclaim
it.&nbsp; So be not in too much haste.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p><a name="page525"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Parliament did not meet to-day, because it was St.
Patrick&rsquo;s Day; and the Mall was so full of crosses that I
thought all the world was Irish.&nbsp; Miss Ashe is almost quite
well, and I see the Bishop, but shall not yet go to his
house.&nbsp; I dined again with Lord Treasurer; but the
Parliament being prorogued, I must keep what I have till next
week: for I believe he will not see it till just the evening
before the session.&nbsp; He has engaged me to dine with him
again to-morrow, though I did all I could to put it off; but I
don&rsquo;t care to disoblige him.&nbsp; Nite dee sollahs

<p>18.&nbsp; I have now dined six days successively with Lord
Treasurer; but to-night I stole away while he was talking with
somebody else, and so am at liberty to-morrow.&nbsp; There was a
flying report of a general cessation of arms: everybody had it at
Court; but, I believe, there is nothing in it.&nbsp; I asked a
certain French Minister how things went.&nbsp; And he whispered
me in French, &ldquo;Your Plenipotentiaries and ours play the
fool.&rdquo;&nbsp; None of us, indeed, approve of the conduct of
either at this time; but Lord Treasurer was in full good-humour
for all that.&nbsp; He had invited a good many of his relations;
and, of a dozen at table, they were all of the Harley family but
myself.&nbsp; Disney is recovering, though you don&rsquo;t care a

Tom.&nbsp; But Sir Andrew Fountaine has wrote to Tom Ashe last
post, and told him the pun, and desired him to send it over to
the Bishop as his own; and, if it succeeds, &rsquo;twill be a
pure bite.&nbsp; The Bishop will tell it us as a wonder that he
and his brother should jump so exactly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you
the pun:&mdash;If there was a hackney coach at Mr. Pooley&rsquo;s

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>March</i> 21, 1712&ndash;13.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">gave</span> your letter in this
night.&nbsp; I dined with Lord Treasurer to-day, and find he has
been at a meeting at Lord Halifax&rsquo;s house, with four
principal Whigs; but he is resolved to begin a speech against
them when the Parliament sits; and I have begged that the
Ministers may have a meeting on purpose to settle that matter,
and let us be the attackers; and I believe it will come to
something, for the Whigs intend to attack the Ministers: and if,
instead of that, the Ministers attack the Whigs, it will be
better: and farther, I believe we shall attack them on those very
points they intend to attack us.&nbsp; The Parliament will be
again prorogued for a fortnight, because of Passion Week.&nbsp; I
forgot to tell you that Mr. Griffin has given Ppt&rsquo;s brother
<a name="citation527b"></a><a href="#footnote527b"
class="citation">[527b]</a> a new employment, about ten pounds a
year better than his former; but more remote, and consequently
cheaper.&nbsp; I wish I could have done better, and hope oo will
take what can be done in good part, and that oo brother will not
dislike it.&mdash;Nite own dear . . . MD.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; I dined to-day with Lord Steward. <a
name="citation527c"></a><a href="#footnote527c"
class="citation">[527c]</a>&nbsp; There Frank Annesley <a
name="citation527d"></a><a href="#footnote527d"
class="citation">[527d]</a> (a Parliament-man) told me he had
heard that I had wrote to my friends in Ireland to keep firm to
the Whig interest; for that Lord Treasurer would certainly
declare for it after the peace.&nbsp; Annesley said twenty people
had told him this.&nbsp; You must know this is what they
endeavour to report of Lord Treasurer, that he designs to declare
for the Whigs; and a Scotch fellow has wrote the same to
Scotland; and his meeting with those lords gives occasion to such
reports.&nbsp; Let me henceforth call Lord Treasurer Eltee,
because possibly my letters may be opened.&nbsp; Pray remember
Eltee.&nbsp; <a name="page528"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
528</span>You know the reason; L. T. and Eltee pronounced the
same way.&nbsp; Stay, &rsquo;tis five weeks since I had a letter
from MD.&nbsp; I allow you six.&nbsp; You see why I cannot come
over the beginning of April; whoever has to do with this Ministry
can fix no time: but as <a name="citation528a"></a><a

<p>23.&nbsp; I dined to-day at Sir Thomas Hanmer&rsquo;s, by an
old appointment: there was the Duke of Ormond, and Lord and Lady
Orkney.&nbsp; I left them at six.&nbsp; Everybody is as sour as
vinegar.&nbsp; I endeavour to keep a firm friendship between the
Duke of Ormond and Eltee.&nbsp; (Oo know who Eltee is, or have oo
fordot already?)&nbsp; I have great designs, if I can compass
them; but delay is rooted in Eltee&rsquo;s heart; yet the fault
is not altogether there, that things are no better.&nbsp; Here is
the cursedest libel in verse come out that ever was seen, called
<i>The Ambassadress</i>; <a name="citation528c"></a><a
href="#footnote528c" class="citation">[528c]</a> it is very dull,
too; it has been printed three or four different ways, and is
handed about, but not sold.&nbsp; It abuses the Queen
horribly.&nbsp; The <i>Examiner</i> has cleared me to-day of
being author of his paper, and done it with great civilities to
me. <a name="citation528d"></a><a href="#footnote528d"
class="citation">[528d]</a>&nbsp; I hope it will stop
people&rsquo;s mouths; if not, they must go on and be hanged, I
care not.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis terribly rainy weather, I&rsquo;ll go
sleep.&nbsp; Nite deelest MD.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; It rained all this day, and ruined me in
coach-hire.&nbsp; I went to Colonel Disney, who is past
danger.&nbsp; Then I visited Lord Keeper, who was at dinner; but
I would not dine with him, but drove to Lord Treasurer (Eltee I
mean), paid the coachman, and went in; but he dined abroad: so I
was forced to call the coachman again, and went to Lord
Bolingbroke&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He dined abroad too; and at Lord
Dupplin&rsquo;s I <a name="page529"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
529</span>alighted, and by good luck got a dinner there, and then
went to the Latin play at Westminster School, acted by the boys;
and Lord Treasurer (Eltee I mean again) honoured them with his
presence.&nbsp; Lady Masham&rsquo;s eldest son, about two years
old, is ill, and I am afraid will not live: she is full of grief,
and I pity and am angry with her.&nbsp; Four shillings to-day in
coach-hire; fais, it won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; Our peace will
certainly be ready by Thursday fortnight; but our
Plenipotentiaries were to blame that it was not done
already.&nbsp; They thought their powers were not full enough to
sign the peace, unless every Prince was ready, which cannot yet
be; for Spain has no Minister yet at Utrecht; but now ours have
new orders.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; Weather worse than ever; terrible rain all day, but
I was resolved I would spend no more money.&nbsp; I went to an
auction of pictures with Dr. Pratt, and there met the Duke of
Beaufort, who promised to come with me to Court, but did
not.&nbsp; So a coach I got, and went to Court, and did some
little business there, but was forced to go home; for oo must
understand I take a little physic over-night, which works me next
day.&nbsp; Lady Orkney is my physician.&nbsp; It is hiera picra,
<a name="citation529a"></a><a href="#footnote529a"
class="citation">[529a]</a> two spoonfuls, devilish stuff!&nbsp;
I thought to have dined with Eltee, but would not, merely to save
a shilling; but I dined privately with a friend, and played at
ombre, and won six shillings.&nbsp; Here are several people of
quality lately dead of the smallpox.&nbsp; I have not yet seen
Miss Ashe, but hear she is well.&nbsp; The Bishop of Clogher has
bought abundance of pictures, and Dr. Pratt has got him very good
pennyworths. <a name="citation529b"></a><a href="#footnote529b"
class="citation">[529b]</a>&nbsp; I can get no walks, the weather
is so bad.&nbsp; Is it so with oo, sollahs? . . . <a
name="citation529c"></a><a href="#footnote529c"
class="citation">[529c]</a></p>
<p>26.&nbsp; Though it was shaving-day, head and beard, yet I was
out early to see Lord Bolingbroke, and talk over affairs with
him; and then I went to the Duke of Ormond&rsquo;s, and so to
Court, where the Ministers did not come, because the Parliament
was prorogued till this day fortnight.&nbsp; We had terrible <a
name="page530"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 530</span>rain and
hail to-day.&nbsp; Our Society met this day, but I left them
before seven, and went to Sir A[ndrew] F[ountaine], and played at
ombre with him and Sir Thomas Clarges, till ten, and then went to
Sir Thomas Hanmer.&nbsp; His wife, the Duchess of Grafton, left
us after a little while, and I stayed with him about an hour,
upon some affairs, etc.&nbsp; Lord Bolingbroke left us at the
Society before I went; for there is an express from Utrecht, but
I know not yet what it contains; only I know the Ministers expect
the peace will be signed in a week, which is a week before the
session.&nbsp; Nite, MD.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; Parnell&rsquo;s poem is mightily esteemed; but
poetry sells ill.&nbsp; I am plagued with that . . . <a
name="citation530a"></a><a href="#footnote530a"
class="citation">[530a]</a> poor Harrison&rsquo;s mother; you
would laugh to see how cautious I am of paying her the &pound;100
I received for her son from the Treasury.&nbsp; I have asked
every creature I know whether I may do it safely, yet durst not
venture, till my Lord Keeper assured me there was no
danger.&nbsp; I have not paid her, but will in a day or two:
though I have a great mind to stay till Ppt sends me her opinion,
because Ppt is a great lawyer.&nbsp; I dined to-day with a
mixture of people at a Scotchman&rsquo;s, who made the invitation
to Mr. Lewis and me, and has some design upon us, which we know
very well.&nbsp; I went afterwards to see a famous moving
picture, <a name="citation530b"></a><a href="#footnote530b"
class="citation">[530b]</a> and I never saw anything so
pretty.&nbsp; You see a sea ten miles wide, a town on
t&rsquo;other end, and ships sailing in the sea, and discharging
their cannon.&nbsp; You see a great sky, with moon and stars,
etc.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a fool.&nbsp; Nite, dee MD.</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; I had a mighty levee to-day.&nbsp; I deny myself to
everybody, except about half a dozen, and they were all here, and
Mr. Addison was one, and I had chocolate twice, which I
don&rsquo;t like.&nbsp; Our rainy weather continues.&nbsp;
Coach-hire goes deep.&nbsp; I dined with Eltee and his Saturday
company, as usual, and could not get away till nine.&nbsp; Lord
Peterborow was making long harangues, and Eltee kept me in
spite.&nbsp; <a name="page531"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
531</span>Then I went to see the Bishop of Ossory, who had
engaged me in the morning; he is going to Ireland.&nbsp; The
Bishop of Killaloe <a name="citation531a"></a><a
href="#footnote531a" class="citation">[531a]</a> and Tom Leigh
was with us.&nbsp; The latter had wholly changed his style, by
seeing how the bishops behaved themselves, and he seemed to think
me one of more importance than I really am.&nbsp; I put the ill
conduct of the bishops about the First-Fruits, with relation to
Eltee and me, strongly upon Killaloe, and showed how it had
hindered me from getting a better thing for them, called the
Crown rents, which the Queen had promised.&nbsp; He had nothing
to say, but was humble, and desired my interest in that and some
other things.&nbsp; This letter is half done in a week: I believe
oo will have it next.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; I have been employed in endeavouring to save one of
your junior Fellows, <a name="citation531b"></a><a
href="#footnote531b" class="citation">[531b]</a> who came over
here for a dispensation from taking orders, and, in soliciting
it, has run out his time, and now his fellowship is void, if the
College pleases, unless the Queen suspends the execution, and
gives him time to take orders.&nbsp; I spoke to all the Ministers
yesterday about it; but they say the Queen is angry, and thought
it was a trick to deceive her; and she is positive, and so the
man must be ruined, for I cannot help him.&nbsp; I never saw him
in my life; but the case was so hard, I could not forbear
interposing.&nbsp; Your Government recommended him to the Duke of
Ormond, and he thought they would grant it; and by the time it
was refused, the fellowship by rigour is forfeited.&nbsp; I dined
with Dr. Arbuthnot (one of my brothers) at his lodgings in
Chelsea, and was there at chapel; and the altar put me in mind of
Tisdall&rsquo;s outlandish would <a name="citation531c"></a><a
href="#footnote531c" class="citation">[531c]</a> at your hospital
for the soldiers.&nbsp; I was not at Court to-day, and I hear the
Queen was not at church.&nbsp; Perhaps the gout has seized her
again.&nbsp; Terrible rain all day.&nbsp; Have oo such
weather?&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; Morning.&nbsp; I was naming some time ago, to a
certain <a name="page532"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
532</span>person, another certain person, that was very
deserving, and poor and sickly; and t&rsquo;other, that first
certain person, gave me a hundred pounds to give the other, which
I have not yet done.&nbsp; The person who is to have it never saw
the giver, nor expects one farthing, nor has the least knowledge
or imagination of it; so I believe it will be a very agreeable
surprise; for I think it is a handsome present enough.&nbsp; At
night I dined in the City, at Pontack&rsquo;s, <a
name="citation532a"></a><a href="#footnote532a"
class="citation">[532a]</a> with Lord Dupplin, and some
others.&nbsp; We were treated by one Colonel Cleland, <a
name="citation532b"></a><a href="#footnote532b"
class="citation">[532b]</a> who has a mind to be Governor of
Barbados, and is laying these long traps for me and others, to
engage our interests for him.&nbsp; He is a true Scotchman.&nbsp;
I paid the hundred pounds this evening, and it was an agreeable
surprise to the receiver.&nbsp; We reckon the peace is now
signed, and that we shall have it in three days.&nbsp; I believe
it is pretty sure.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; I thought to-day on Ppt when she told me she
suppose[d] I was acquainted with the steward, when I was giving
myself airs of being at some lord&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Sir Andrew
Fountaine invited the Bishop of Clogher and me, and some others,
to dine where he did; and he carried us to the Duke of
Kent&rsquo;s, <a name="citation532c"></a><a href="#footnote532c"
class="citation">[532c]</a> who was gone out of town; but the
steward treated us nobly, and showed us the fine pictures,
etc.&nbsp; I have not yet seen Miss Ashe.&nbsp; I wait till she
has been abroad, <a name="page533"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
533</span>and taken the air.&nbsp; This evening Lady Masham, Dr.
Arbuthnot, and I, were contriving a lie for to-morrow, that Mr.
Noble, <a name="citation533a"></a><a href="#footnote533a"
class="citation">[533a]</a> who was hanged last Saturday, was
recovered by his friends, and then seized again by the sheriff,
and is now in a messenger&rsquo;s hands at the Black Swan in
Holborn.&nbsp; We are all to send to our friends, to know whether
they have heard anything of it, and so we hope it will
spread.&nbsp; However, we shall do our endeavours; nothing shall
be wanting on our parts, and leave the rest to fortune.&nbsp;
Nite MD.</p>
<p>April 1.&nbsp; We had no success in our story, though I sent
my man to several houses, to inquire among the footmen, without
letting him into the secret; but I doubt my colleagues did not
contribute as they ought.&nbsp; Parnell and I dined with
Darteneuf <a name="citation533b"></a><a href="#footnote533b"
class="citation">[533b]</a> to-day.&nbsp; You have heard of
Darteneuf: I have told you of Darteneuf.&nbsp; After dinner we
all went to Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s, who had desired me to dine
with him; but I would not, because I heard it was to look over a
dull poem of one parson Trapp <a name="citation533c"></a><a
href="#footnote533c" class="citation">[533c]</a> upon the
peace.&nbsp; The Swedish Envoy told me to-day at Court that he
was in great apprehensions about his master; <a
name="citation533d"></a><a href="#footnote533d"
class="citation">[533d]</a> and indeed we are afraid that prince
has <a name="citation533e"></a><a href="#footnote533e"
class="citation">[533e]</a> died among those Turkish dogs.&nbsp;
I prevailed on Lord Bolingbroke to invite Mr. Addison to dine
with him on Good Friday.&nbsp; I suppose we shall be mighty
mannerly.&nbsp; Addison is to have a play of his acted on Friday
in Easter Week: &rsquo;tis a tragedy, called <i>Cato</i>; I saw
it unfinished some years ago. <a name="citation533f"></a><a
href="#footnote533f" class="citation">[533f]</a>&nbsp; Did I tell
you that Steele has begun a new daily paper, called the
<i>Guardian</i>? <a name="citation533g"></a><a
href="#footnote533g" class="citation">[533g]</a> they say good
for nothing.&nbsp; I have not seen it.&nbsp; Nite dee MD.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I was this morning with Lord Bolingbroke, and he
tells <a name="page534"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 534</span>me
a Spanish courier is just come, with the news that the King of
Spain has agreed to everything that the Queen desires; and the
Duke d&rsquo;Ossuna has left Paris in order to his journey to
Utrecht.&nbsp; I was prevailed on to come home with Trapp, and
read his poem and correct it; but it was good for nothing.&nbsp;
While I was thus employed, Sir Thomas Hanmer came up to my
chamber, and balked me of a journey he and I intended this week
to Lord Orkney&rsquo;s at Cliffden; <a name="citation534a"></a><a
href="#footnote534a" class="citation">[534a]</a> but he is not
well, and his physician will not let him undertake such a
journey.&nbsp; I intended to dine with Lord Treasurer; but going
to see Colonel Disney, who lives with General Withers, <a
name="citation534b"></a><a href="#footnote534b"
class="citation">[534b]</a> I liked the General&rsquo;s little
dinner so well, that I stayed and took share of it, and did not
go to Lord Treasurer till six, where I found Dr. Sacheverell, who
told us that the bookseller had given him &pound;100 for his
sermon, <a name="citation534c"></a><a href="#footnote534c"
class="citation">[534c]</a> preached last Sunday, and intended to
print 30,000: I believe he will be confoundedly bit, and will
hardly sell above half.&nbsp; I have fires still, though April
has begun, against my old maxim; but the weather is wet and
cold.&nbsp; I never saw such a long run of ill weather in my
life.&nbsp; Nite dee logues MD.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I was at the Queen&rsquo;s chapel to-day, but she was
not there.&nbsp; Mr. St. John, Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s brother,
came this day at noon with an express from Utrecht, that the
peace is signed by all the Ministers there, but those of the
Emperor, who will likewise sign in a few days; so that now the
great work is in effect done, and I believe it will appear a most
excellent peace for Europe, particularly for England.&nbsp;
Addison and I, and some others, dined with Lord Bolingbroke, and
sat with him till twelve.&nbsp; We were very civil, but yet when
we grew warm, we talked in a friendly manner of party.&nbsp;
Addison raised his objections, and Lord Bolingbroke answered them
with great complaisance.&nbsp; Addison began Lord Somers&rsquo;s
<a name="page535"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 535</span>health,
which went about; but I bid him not name Lord Wharton&rsquo;s,
for I would not pledge it; and I told Lord Bolingbroke frankly
that Addison loved Lord Wharton as little as I did: so we
laughed, etc.&nbsp; Well, but you are glad of the peace, you Ppt
the Trimmer, are not you?&nbsp; As for DD I don&rsquo;t doubt
her.&nbsp; Why, now, if I did not think Ppt had been a violent
Tory, and DD the greater Whig of the two!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
late.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; This Passion Week, people are so demure, especially
this last day, that I told Dilly, who called here, that I would
dine with him, and so I did, faith; and had a small shoulder of
mutton of my own bespeaking.&nbsp; It rained all day.&nbsp; I
came home at seven, and have never stirred out, but have been
reading Sacheverell&rsquo;s long dull sermon, which he sent
me.&nbsp; It is the first sermon since his suspension is expired;
but not a word in it upon the occasion, except two or three
remote hints.&nbsp; The Bishop of Clogher has been sadly bit by
Tom Ashe, who sent him a pun, which the Bishop had made, and
designed to send to him, but delayed it; and Lord Pembroke and I
made Sir Andrew Fountaine write it to Tom.&nbsp; I believe I told
you of it in my last; it succeeded right, and the Bishop was
wondering to Lord Pembroke how he and his brother could hit on
the same thing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go to bed soon, for I must be at
church by eight to-morrow, Easter Day.&nbsp; Nite dee MD.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Warburton <a name="citation535a"></a><a
href="#footnote535a" class="citation">[535a]</a> wrote to me two
letters about a living of one Foulkes, who is lately dead in the
county of Meath.&nbsp; My answer is, that before I received the
first letter, General Gorges <a name="citation535b"></a><a
href="#footnote535b" class="citation">[535b]</a> had recommended
a friend of his to the Duke of Ormond, which was the first time I
heard of its vacancy, and it was the Provost told me of it.&nbsp;
I believe verily that Foulkes was not dead when Gorges
recommended the other: <a name="page536"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 536</span>for Warburton&rsquo;s last letter
said that Foulkes was dead the day before the date.&mdash;This
has prevented me from serving Warburton, as I would have done, if
I had received early notice enough.&nbsp; Pray say or write this
to Warburton, to justify me to him.&nbsp; I was at church at
eight this morning, and dressed and shaved after I came back, but
was too late at Court; and Lord Abingdon <a
name="citation536a"></a><a href="#footnote536a"
class="citation">[536a]</a> was like to have snapped me for
dinner, and I believe will fall out with me for refusing him; but
I hate dining with them, and I dined with a private friend, and
took two or three good walks; for it was a very fine day, the
first we have had a great while.&nbsp; Remember, was Easter Day a
fine day with you?&nbsp; I have sat with Lady Worsley till
now.&nbsp; Nite dee MD.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I was this morning at ten at the rehearsal of Mr.
Addison&rsquo;s play, called Cato, which is to be acted on
Friday.&nbsp; There were not above half a score of us to see
it.&nbsp; We stood on the stage, and it was foolish enough to see
the actors prompted every moment, and the poet directing them;
and the drab that acts Cato&rsquo;s daughter, <a
name="citation536b"></a><a href="#footnote536b"
class="citation">[536b]</a> out in the midst of a passionate
part, and then calling out, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
next?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Bishop of Clogher was there too; but he
stood privately in a gallery.&nbsp; I went to dine with Lord
Treasurer, but he was gone to Wimbledon, his daughter
Caermarthen&rsquo;s <a name="citation536c"></a><a
href="#footnote536c" class="citation">[536c]</a> country seat,
seven miles off.&nbsp; So I went back, and dined privately with
Mr. Addison, whom I had left to go to Lord Treasurer.&nbsp; I
keep fires yet; I am very extravagant.&nbsp; I sat this evening
with Sir A. Fountaine, and we amused ourselves with making
<i>ifs</i> for Dilly.&nbsp; It is rainy weather again; nevle saw
ze rike. <a name="citation536d"></a><a href="#footnote536d"
class="citation">[536d]</a>&nbsp; This letter shall go to-morrow;
remember, ung oomens, it is seven weeks since oor last, and I
allow oo but five weeks; but oo have been galloping into the

href="#footnote536e" class="citation">[536e]</a>&nbsp; O pray
tell Swanton I had his letter, but cannot contrive how to serve
him.&nbsp; If a Governor were to go over, I would recommend him
as far as lay in my power, but I can do no more: and you know all
employments in Ireland, at <a name="page537"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 537</span>least almost all, are engaged in
reversions.&nbsp; If I were on the spot, and had credit with a
Lord Lieutenant, I would very heartily recommend him; but
employments here are no more in my power than the monarchy

<h3>LETTER LXIII. <a name="citation537b"></a><a

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
<i>April</i> 7, 1713.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">fancy</span> I marked my last, which I
sent this day, wrong; only 61, and it ought to be 62.&nbsp; I
dined with Lord Treasurer, and though the business I had with him
is something against Thursday, when the Parliament is to meet,
and this is Tuesday, yet he put it off till to-morrow.&nbsp; I
dare not tell you what it is, lest this letter should miscarry or
be opened; but I never saw his fellow for delays.&nbsp; The
Parliament will now certainly sit, and everybody&rsquo;s
expectations are ready to burst.&nbsp; At a Council to-night the
Lord Chief-Justice Parker, a Whig, spoke against the peace; so
did Lord <a name="page538"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
538</span>Chomley, <a name="citation538a"></a><a
href="#footnote538a" class="citation">[538a]</a> another Whig,
who is Treasurer of the Household.&nbsp; My Lord Keeper <a
name="citation538b"></a><a href="#footnote538b"
class="citation">[538b]</a> was this night made Lord
Chancellor.&nbsp; We hope there will soon be some removes.&nbsp;
Nite, dee sollahs; Late.&nbsp; Rove Pdfr. <a
name="citation538c"></a><a href="#footnote538c"
class="citation">[538c]</a></p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Lord Chomley (the right name is Cholmondeley) is this
day removed from his employment, for his last night&rsquo;s
speech; and Sir Richard Temple, <a name="citation538d"></a><a
href="#footnote538d" class="citation">[538d]</a>
Lieutenant-General, the greatest Whig in the army, is turned out;
and Lieutenant-General Palmes <a name="citation538e"></a><a
href="#footnote538e" class="citation">[538e]</a> will be obliged
to sell his regiment.&nbsp; This is the first-fruits of a
friendship I have established between two great men.&nbsp; I
dined with Lord Treasurer, and did the business I had for him to
his satisfaction.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t tell MD what it was. . . .
<a name="citation538f"></a><a href="#footnote538f"
class="citation">[538f]</a> for zat.&nbsp; The Parliament sits
to-morrow for certain.&nbsp; Here is a letter printed in
Maccartney&rsquo;s name, vindicating himself from the murder of
the Duke of Hamilton.&nbsp; I must give some hints to have it
answered; &rsquo;tis full of lies, and will give an opportunity
of exposing that party.&nbsp; To morrow will be a very important
day.&nbsp; All the world will be at Westminster.&nbsp; Lord
Treasurer is as easy as a lamb.&nbsp; They are mustering up the
proxies of the absent lords; but they are not in any fear of
wanting a majority, which death and accidents have increased this
year.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; I was this morning with Lord Treasurer, to present to
him a young son <a name="citation538g"></a><a
href="#footnote538g" class="citation">[538g]</a> of the late Earl
of Jersey, at the desire of the widow.&nbsp; There I saw the mace
and great coach ready for Lord Treasurer, who was going to
Parliament.&nbsp; Our Society met to-day; but I expected the
Houses would sit longer than I cared to fast; so I dined with a
friend, and never inquired how matters went till eight this
evening, when I went to Lord Orkney&rsquo;s, where I found Sir
Thomas Hanmer.&nbsp; The Queen delivered her speech very well,
but a little weaker <a name="page539"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 539</span>in her voice.&nbsp; The crowd was
vast.&nbsp; The order for the Address <a
name="citation539a"></a><a href="#footnote539a"
class="citation">[539a]</a> was moved, and opposed by Lord
Nottingham, Halifax, and Cowper.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer spoke with
great spirit and resolution; Lord Peterborow flirted <a
name="citation539b"></a><a href="#footnote539b"
class="citation">[539b]</a> against the Duke of Marlborough (who
is in Germany, you know), but it was in answer to one of
Halifax&rsquo;s impertinences.&nbsp; The order for an Address
passed by a majority of thirty-three, and the Houses rose before
six.&nbsp; This is the account I heard at Lord
Orkney&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The Bishop of Chester, <a
name="citation539c"></a><a href="#footnote539c"
class="citation">[539c]</a> a high Tory, was against the
Court.&nbsp; The Duchess of Marlborough sent for him some months
ago, to justify herself to him in relation to the Queen, and
showed him letters, and told him stories, which the weak man
believed, and was perverted.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; I dined with a cousin in the City, and poor Pat Rolt
was there.&nbsp; I have got her rogue of a husband leave to come
to England from Port-Mahon.&nbsp; The Whigs are much down; but I
reckon they have some scheme in agitation.&nbsp; This
Parliament-time hinders our Court meetings on Wednesdays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays.&nbsp; I had a great deal of business
to-night, which gave me a temptation to be idle, and I lost a
dozen shillings at ombre, with Dr. Pratt and another.&nbsp; I
have been to see t&rsquo;other day the Bishop of Clogher and
lady, but did not see Miss.&nbsp; It rains every day, and yet we
are all over dust.&nbsp; Lady Masham&rsquo;s eldest boy is very
ill: I doubt he will not live, and she stays at Kensington to
nurse him, which vexes us all.&nbsp; She is so excessively fond,
it makes me mad.&nbsp; She should never leave the Queen, but
leave everything, to stick to what is so much the interest of the
public, as well as her own.&nbsp; This I tell her; but talk to
the winds.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; I dined at Lord Treasurer&rsquo;s, with his Saturday
company.&nbsp; We had ten at table, all lords but myself and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer.&nbsp; Argyle went off at six, and
was in very <a name="page540"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
540</span>indifferent humour as usual.&nbsp; Duke of Ormond and
Lord Bolingbroke were absent.&nbsp; I stayed till near ten.&nbsp;
Lord Treasurer showed us a small picture, enamelled work, and set
in gold, worth about twenty pounds; a picture, I mean, of the
Queen, which she gave to the Duchess of Marlborough, set in
diamonds.&nbsp; When the Duchess was leaving England, she took
off all the diamonds, and gave the picture to one Mrs. Higgins
(an old intriguing woman, whom everybody knows), bidding her make
the best of it she could.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer sent to Mrs.
Higgins for this picture, and gave her a hundred pounds for
it.&nbsp; Was ever such an ungrateful beast as that Duchess? or
did you ever hear such a story?&nbsp; I suppose the Whigs will
not believe it.&nbsp; Pray, try them.&nbsp; Takes off the
diamonds, and gives away the picture to an insignificant woman,
as a thing of no consequence: and gives it to her to sell, like a
piece of old-fashioned plate.&nbsp; Is she not a detestable
slut?&nbsp; Nite deelest MD.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; I went to Court to-day, on purpose to present Mr.
Berkeley, <a name="citation540"></a><a href="#footnote540"
class="citation">[540]</a> one of your Fellows of Dublin College,
to Lord Berkeley of Stratton.&nbsp; That Mr. Berkeley is a very
ingenious man, and great philosopher, and I have mentioned him to
all the Ministers, and given them some of his writings; and I
will favour him as much as I can.&nbsp; This I think I am bound
to, in honour and conscience, to use all my little credit toward
helping forward men of worth in the world.&nbsp; The Queen was at
chapel to-day, and looks well.&nbsp; I dined at Lord
Orkney&rsquo;s with the Duke of Ormond, Lord Arran, and Sir
Thomas Hanmer.&nbsp; Mr. St. John, Secretary at Utrecht, expects
every moment to return there with the ratification <a
name="page541"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 541</span>of the
peace.&nbsp; Did I tell you in my last of Addison&rsquo;s play
called Cato, and that I was at the rehearsal of it?&nbsp; Nite
MD.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; This morning my friend, Mr. Lewis, came to me, and
showed me an order for a warrant for the three vacant deaneries;
but none of them to me.&nbsp; This was what I always foresaw, and
received the notice of it better, I believe, than he
expected.&nbsp; I bid Mr. Lewis tell Lord Treasurer that I took
nothing ill of him but his not giving me timely notice, as he
promised to do, if he found the Queen would do nothing for
me.&nbsp; At noon, Lord Treasurer hearing I was in Mr.
Lewis&rsquo;s office, came to me, and said many things too long
to repeat.&nbsp; I told him I had nothing to do but go to Ireland
immediately; for I could not, with any reputation, stay longer
here, unless I had something honourable immediately given to
me.&nbsp; We dined together at the Duke of Ormond&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
He there told me he had stopped the warrants for the deans, that
what was done for me might be at the same time, and he hoped to
compass it to-night; but I believe him not.&nbsp; I told the Duke
of Ormond my intentions.&nbsp; He is content Sterne should be a
bishop, and I have St. Patrick&rsquo;s; but I believe nothing
will come of it, for stay I will not; and so I believe for all oo
. . . <a name="citation541"></a><a href="#footnote541"
class="citation">[541]</a> oo may see me in Dublin before April
ends.&nbsp; I am less out of humour than you would imagine: and
if it were not that impertinent people will condole with me, as
they used to give me joy, I would value it less.&nbsp; But I will
avoid company, and muster up my baggage, and send them next
Monday by the carrier to Chester, and come and see my willows,
against the expectation of all the world.&mdash;Hat care I?&nbsp;
Nite deelest logues, MD.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; I dined in the City to-day, and ordered a lodging to
be got ready for me against I came to pack up my things; for I
will leave this end of the town as soon as ever the warrants for
the deaneries are out, which are yet stopped.&nbsp; <a
name="page542"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 542</span>Lord
Treasurer told Mr. Lewis that it should be determined to-night:
and so he will for <a name="citation542a"></a><a
href="#footnote542a" class="citation">[542a]</a> a hundred
nights.&nbsp; So he said yesterday, but I value it not.&nbsp; My
daily journals shall be but short till I get into the City, and
then I will send away this, and follow it myself; and design to
walk it all the way to Chester, my man and I, by ten miles a
day.&nbsp; It will do my health a great deal of good.&nbsp; I
shall do it in fourteen days.&nbsp; Nite dee MD.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; Lord Bolingbroke made me dine with him to-day; he <a
name="citation542b"></a><a href="#footnote542b"
class="citation">[542b]</a> was as good company as ever; and told
me the Queen would determine something for me to-night.&nbsp; The
dispute is, Windsor or St. Patrick&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I told him I
would not stay for their disputes, and he thought I was in the
right.&nbsp; Lord Masham told me that Lady Masham is angry I have
not been to see her since this business, and desires I will come
to-morrow.&nbsp; Nite deelest MD.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; I was this noon at Lady Masham&rsquo;s, who was just
come from Kensington, where her eldest son is sick.&nbsp; She
said much to me of what she had talked to the Queen and Lord
Treasurer.&nbsp; The poor lady fell a shedding tears
openly.&nbsp; She could not bear to think of my having St.
Patrick&rsquo;s, etc.&nbsp; I was never more moved than to see so
much friendship.&nbsp; I would not stay with her, but went and
dined with Dr. Arbuthnot, with Mr. Berkeley, one of your Fellows,
whom I have recommended to the Doctor, and to Lord Berkeley of
Stratton.&nbsp; Mr. Lewis tells me that the Duke of Ormond has
been to-day with the Queen; and she was content that Dr. Sterne
should be Bishop of Dromore, and I Dean of St. Patrick&rsquo;s;
but then out came Lord Treasurer, and said he would not be
satisfied but that I must be Prebend[ary] of Windsor.&nbsp; Thus
he perplexes things.&nbsp; I expect neither; but I confess, as
much as I love England, I am so angry at this treatment that, if
I had my choice, I would rather have St. Patrick&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Lady Masham says she will speak to purpose to the Queen
to-morrow.&nbsp; Nite, . . . dee MD.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; I went to dine at Lady Masham&rsquo;s to-day, and
she was <a name="page543"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
543</span>taken ill of a sore throat, and aguish.&nbsp; She spoke
to the Queen last night, but had not much time.&nbsp; The Queen
says she will determine to-morrow with Lord Treasurer.&nbsp; The
warrants for the deaneries are still stopped, for fear I should
be gone.&nbsp; Do you think anything will be done?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t care whether it is or no.&nbsp; In the meantime, I
prepare for my journey, and see no great people, nor will see
Lord Treasurer any more, if I go.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer told Mr.
Lewis it should be done to-night; so he said five nights
ago.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; This morning Mr. Lewis sent me word that Lord
Treasurer told him the Queen would determine at noon.&nbsp; At
three Lord Treasurer sent to me to come to his lodgings at St.
James&rsquo;s, and told me the Queen was at last resolved that
Dr. Sterne should be Bishop of Dromore, and I Dean of St.
Patrick&rsquo;s; and that Sterne&rsquo;s warrant should be drawn
immediately.&nbsp; You know the deanery is in the Duke of
Ormond&rsquo;s gift; but this is concerted between the Queen,
Lord Treasurer, and the Duke of Ormond, to make room for
me.&nbsp; I do not know whether it will yet be done; some unlucky
accident may yet come.&nbsp; Neither can I feel joy at passing my
days in Ireland; and I confess I thought the Ministry would not
let me go; but perhaps they can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; Nite
MD.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; I forgot to tell you that Lord Treasurer forced me
to dine with him yesterday as usual, with his Saturday company;
which I did after frequent refusals.&nbsp; To-day I dined with a
private friend, and was not at Court.&nbsp; After dinner Mr.
Lewis sent me a note, that the Queen stayed till she knew whether
the Duke of Ormond approved of Sterne for Bishop.&nbsp; I went
this evening, and found the Duke of Ormond at the Cock-pit, and
told him, and desired he would go to the Queen, and approve of
Sterne.&nbsp; He made objections, desired I would name any other
deanery, for he did not like Sterne; that Sterne never went to
see him; that he was influenced by the Archbishop of Dublin,
etc.; so all now is broken again.&nbsp; I sent out for Lord
Treasurer, and told him <a name="page544"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 544</span>this.&nbsp; He says all will do
well; but I value not what he says.&nbsp; This suspense vexes me
worse than anything else.&nbsp; Nite MD.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; I went to-day, by appointment, to the Cock-pit, to
talk with the Duke of Ormond.&nbsp; He repeated the same
proposals of any other deanery, etc.&nbsp; I desired he would put
me out of the case, and do as he pleased.&nbsp; Then, with great
kindness, he said he would consent; but would do it for no man
alive but me, etc.&nbsp; And he will speak to the Queen to-day or
to-morrow; so, perhaps, something will come of it.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; Nite dee dee logues, MD.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; The Duke of Ormond has told the Queen he is
satisfied that Sterne should be Bishop, and she consents I shall
be Dean; and I suppose the warrants will be drawn in a day or
two.&nbsp; I dined at an ale-house with Parnell and Berkeley; for
I am not in humour to go among the Ministers, though Lord
Dartmouth invited me to dine with him to-day, and Lord Treasurer
was to be there.&nbsp; I said I would, if I were out of
suspense.&nbsp; Nite deelest MD.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; The Queen says warrants shall be drawn, but she will
dispose of all in England and Ireland at once, to be teased no
more.&nbsp; This will delay it some time; and, while it is
delayed, I am not sure of the Queen, my enemies being busy.&nbsp;
I hate this suspense.&nbsp; Nite deelest MD. <a

class="citation">[544a]</a></p>
<p>23.&nbsp; I dined yesterday with General Hamilton. <a
name="citation544b"></a><a href="#footnote544b"
class="citation">[544b]</a>&nbsp; I forgot to tell oo.&nbsp; I
write short journals now.&nbsp; I have eggs on the spit.&nbsp;
This night the Queen has signed all the warrants, among which
Sterne is Bishop of Dromore, and the Duke of Ormond is to send
over an order for making me Dean of St. Patrick&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I
have no doubt of him at all.&nbsp; I think &rsquo;tis now
passed.&nbsp; And I suppose MD is malicious enough <a
name="page545"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 545</span>to be glad,
and rather have it than Wells. <a name="citation545a"></a><a
href="#footnote545a" class="citation">[545a]</a>&nbsp; But you
see what a condition I am in.&nbsp; I thought I was to pay but
six hundred pounds for the house; but the Bishop of Clogher says
eight hundred pounds; first-fruits one hundred and fifty pounds,
and so, with patent, a thousand pounds in all; so that I shall
not be the better for the deanery these three years.&nbsp; I hope
in some time they will be persuaded here to give me some money to
pay off these debts.&nbsp; I must finish the book I am writing,
<a name="citation545b"></a><a href="#footnote545b"
class="citation">[545b]</a> before I can go over; and they expect
I shall pass next winter here, and then I will dun them to give
me a sum of money.&nbsp; However, I hope to pass four or five
months with MD, and whatever comes on it.&nbsp; MD&rsquo;s
allowance must be increased, and shall be too, fais . . . <a
name="citation545c"></a><a href="#footnote545c"
class="citation">[545c]</a>&nbsp; I received oor rettle No. 39
to-night; just ten weeks since I had your last.&nbsp; I shall
write next post to Bishop Sterne.&nbsp; Never man had so many
enemies of Ireland <a name="citation545d"></a><a
href="#footnote545d" class="citation">[545d]</a> as he.&nbsp; I
carried it with the strongest hand possible.&nbsp; If he does not
use me well and gently in what dealings I shall have with him, he
will be the most ungrateful of mankind.&nbsp; The Archbishop of
York, <a name="citation545e"></a><a href="#footnote545e"
class="citation">[545e]</a> my mortal enemy, has sent, by a third
hand, that he would be glad to see me.&nbsp; Shall I see him, or
not?&nbsp; I hope to be over in a month, and that MD, with their
raillery, will be mistaken, that I shall make it three
years.&nbsp; I will answer oo rettle soon; but no more
journals.&nbsp; I shall be very busy.&nbsp; Short letters from
hence forward.&nbsp; I shall not part with Laracor.&nbsp; That is
all I have to live on, except the deanery be worth more than four
hundred pounds a year.&nbsp; Is it?&nbsp; If it be, the overplus
shall be divided between MD and FW beside usual allowance of MD.

class="citation">[545f]</a>&nbsp; Pray write to me a
good-humoured letter immediately, let it be ever so short.&nbsp;

I went myself, but it was past eleven, and asked the
reason.&nbsp; Killaloe is removed to Raphoe, and he has a mind to
have an order for the rents of Raphoe, that have fallen due since
the vacancy, and he would have all stop till he has gotten
that.&nbsp; A pretty request!&nbsp; But the clerk, at Mr.
Lewis&rsquo;s message, sent the warrants for Sterne and me; but
then it was too late to send this, which frets me heartily, that
MD should not have intelligence first from Pdfr.&nbsp; I think to
take a hundred pounds a year out of the deanery, and divide it

<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> yours, No. 40,
yesterday.&nbsp; Your new Bishop acts very ungratefully.&nbsp; I
cannot say so bad of it as he deserved.&nbsp; I begged at the
same post his warrant and mine went over, that he would leave
those livings to my disposal.&nbsp; I shall write this post to
him to let him know how ill I take it.&nbsp; I have letters to
tell me that I ought to think of employing some body to set the
tithes of the deanery.&nbsp; I know not what to do at this
distance.&nbsp; I cannot be in Ireland under a month.&nbsp; I
will write two orders; one to Parvisol, and t&rsquo;other to
Parvisol, and a blank for whatever fellow it is whom the last
Dean employed; and I would desire you to advise with friends
which to make use of: and if the latter, let the fellow&rsquo;s
name be inserted, and both act by commission.&nbsp; If the
former, then speak to Parvisol, and know whether he can undertake
it.&nbsp; I doubt it is hardly to be done by a perfect stranger
alone, as Parvisol is.&nbsp; He may perhaps venture at all, to
keep up his interest with me; but that is needless, for I am
willing to do him any good, that will do me no harm.&nbsp; <a

with Walls and Raymond, and a little with Bishop Sterne for
form.&nbsp; Tell Raymond I cannot succeed for him to get that
living of Moimed.&nbsp; It is represented here as a great
sinecure.&nbsp; Several chaplains have solicited for it; and it
has vexed me so, that, if I live, I will make it my business to
serve him better in something else.&nbsp; I am heartily sorry for
his illness, and that of the other two.&nbsp; If it be not
necessary to let the tithes till a month hence, you may keep the
two papers, and advise well in the meantime; and whenever it is
absolutely necessary, then give that paper which you are most
advised to.&nbsp; I thank Mr. Walls for his letter.&nbsp; Tell
him that must serve for an answer, with my service to him and
her.&nbsp; I shall buy Bishop Sterne&rsquo;s hair as soon as his
household goods.&nbsp; I shall be ruined, or at least sadly
cramped, unless the Queen will give me a thousand pounds.&nbsp; I
am sure she owes me a great deal more.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer
rallies me upon it, and I believe intends it; but, quando?&nbsp;
I am advised to hasten over as soon as possible, and so I will,
and hope to set out the beginning of June.&nbsp; Take no lodging
for me.&nbsp; What? at your old tricks again?&nbsp; I can lie

<h3>LETTER LXV. <a name="citation549b"></a><a

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Chester</span>,
<i>June</i> 6, 1713.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> come here after six
days.&nbsp; I set out on Monday last, and got here to-day about
eleven in the morning.&nbsp; A noble rider, fais! and all the
ships and people went off yesterday with a rare wind.&nbsp; This
was told me, to my comfort, upon my arrival.&nbsp; Having not
used riding these three years, made me terrible weary; yet I
resolve on Monday to set out for Holyhead, as weary as I
am.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis good for my health, mam.&nbsp; When I came
here, I found MD&rsquo;s letter of the 26th of May sent down to
me.&nbsp; Had you writ a post sooner I might have brought some
pins: but you were lazy, and would not write your orders
immediately, as I desired you.&nbsp; I will come when God
pleases; perhaps I may be with you in a week.&nbsp; I will be
three days going to Holyhead; I cannot ride faster, say hat oo
will.&nbsp; I am upon Stay-behind&rsquo;s mare.&nbsp; I have the
whole inn to myself.&nbsp; I would fain &rsquo;scape this
Holyhead journey; but I have no prospect of ships, and it will be
almost necessary I should be in Dublin before the 25th instant,
to take the oaths; <a name="citation549c"></a><a
href="#footnote549c" class="citation">[549c]</a> otherwise I must
wait to a <a name="page550"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
550</span>quarter sessions.&nbsp; I will lodge as I can;
therefore take no lodgings for me, to pay in my absence.&nbsp;
The poor Dean can&rsquo;t afford it.&nbsp; I spoke again to the
Duke of Ormond about Moimed for Raymond, and hope he may yet have
it, for I laid it strongly to the Duke, and gave him the Bishop
of Meath&rsquo;s memorial.&nbsp; I am sorry for Raymond&rsquo;s
fistula; tell him so.&nbsp; I will speak to Lord Treasurer about
Mrs. South <a name="citation550a"></a><a href="#footnote550a"
class="citation">[550a]</a> to-morrow.&nbsp; Odso! I forgot; I
thought I had been in London.&nbsp; Mrs. Tisdall <a
name="citation550b"></a><a href="#footnote550b"
class="citation">[550b]</a> is very big, ready to lie down.&nbsp;
Her husband is a puppy.&nbsp; Do his feet stink still?&nbsp; The
letters to Ireland go at so uncertain an hour, that I am forced
to conclude.&nbsp; Farewell, MD, MD MD FW FW FW ME ME ME ME.</p>

who have been married may form juster ideas of that estate than I
can pretend to do&rdquo; (Dr. Birkbeck Hill&rsquo;s
<i>Unpublished Letters of Dean Swift</i>, p. 237).</p>
<p><a name="footnote0h"></a><a href="#citation0h"
class="footnote">[0h]</a>&nbsp; Scott added a new incident which
has become incorporated in the popular conception of
Swift&rsquo;s story.&nbsp; Delany is said to have met Swift
rushing out of Archbishop King&rsquo;s study, with a countenance
of distraction, immediately after the wedding.&nbsp; King, who
was in tears, said, &ldquo;You have just met the most unhappy man
on earth; but on the subject of his wretchedness you must never
ask a question.&rdquo;&nbsp; Will it be believed that
Scott&mdash;who rejects Delany&rsquo;s inference from this
alleged incident&mdash;had no better authority for it than
&ldquo;a friend of his (Delany&rsquo;s) relict&rdquo;?</p>
<p><a name="footnote0i"></a><a href="#citation0i"
class="footnote">[0i]</a>&nbsp; This incident, for which there is
probably some foundation of fact&mdash;we cannot say how
much&mdash;has been greatly expanded by Mrs. Woods in her novel
<i>Esther Vanhomrigh</i>.&nbsp; Unfortunately most of her readers
cannot, of course, judge exactly how far her story is a work of
imagination.</p>
<p><a name="footnote0j"></a><a href="#citation0j"
class="footnote">[0j]</a>&nbsp; In October Swift explained that
he had been in the country &ldquo;partly to see a lady of my old
acquaintance, who was extremely ill&rdquo; (<i>Unpublished
Letters of Dean Swift</i>, p. 198).</p>
<p><a name="footnote0k"></a><a href="#citation0k"
class="footnote">[0k]</a>&nbsp; There is a story that shortly
before her death Swift begged Stella to allow herself to be
publicly announced as his wife, but that she replied that it was
then too late.&nbsp; The versions given by Delany and Theophilus
Swift differ considerably, while Sheridan alters the whole thing
by representing Swift as brutally refusing to comply with
Stella&rsquo;s last wishes.</p>
<p><a name="footnote0l"></a><a href="#citation0l"
class="footnote">[0l]</a>&nbsp; There has also been the absurd
suggestion that the impediment was Swift&rsquo;s knowledge that
both he and Stella were the illegitimate children of Sir William
Temple&mdash;a theory which is absolutely disproved by known
facts.</p>
<p><a name="footnote0m"></a><a href="#citation0m"
class="footnote">[0m]</a>&nbsp; It is curious to note the
intimate knowledge of some of Swift&rsquo;s peculiarities which
was possessed by the hostile writer of a pamphlet called <i>A Hue
and Cry after Dr. S&mdash;t</i>, published in 1714.&nbsp; That
piece consists, for the most part, of extracts from a supposed
Diary by Swift, and contains such passages as these:
&ldquo;<i>Friday</i>.&nbsp; Go to the Club . . .&nbsp; Am
treated.&nbsp; Expenses one shilling.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Saturday</i>.&nbsp; Bid my servant get all things ready
for a journey to the country: mend my breeches; hire a
washerwoman, making her allow for old shirts, socks, dabbs and
markees, which she bought of me . . .&nbsp; Six coaches of
quality, and nine hacks, this day called at my
lodgings.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Thursday</i>.&nbsp; The Earl
looked queerly: left him in a huff.&nbsp; Bid him send for me
when he was fit for company. . . .&nbsp; Spent ten
shillings.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote0n"></a><a href="#citation0n"
class="footnote">[0n]</a>&nbsp; The &ldquo;little language&rdquo;
is marked chiefly by such changes of letters (e.g., l for r, or r
for l) as a child makes when learning to speak.&nbsp; The
combinations of letters in which Swift indulges are not so easy
of interpretation.&nbsp; For himself he uses Pdfr, and sometimes
Podefar or FR (perhaps Poor dear foolish rogue).&nbsp; Stella is
Ppt (Poor pretty thing).&nbsp; MD (my dears) usually stands for
both Stella and Mrs. Dingley, but sometimes for Stella
alone.&nbsp; Mrs. Dingley is indicated by ME (Madam Elderly), D,
or DD (Dear Dingley).&nbsp; The letters FW may mean Farewell, or
Foolish Wenches.&nbsp; Lele seems sometimes to be There, there,
and sometimes Truly.</p>

at Mr. Curry&rsquo;s house over against the Ram in Capel Street,
Dublin, Ireland,&rdquo; and endorsed by Esther Johnson,
&ldquo;Sept. 9. Received.&rdquo;&nbsp; Afterwards Swift added,
&ldquo;MD received this Sept. 9,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Letters to
Ireland from Sept.1710, begun soon after the change of
Ministry.&nbsp; Nothing in this.&rdquo;</p>

class="footnote">[1b]</a>&nbsp; Beaumont is the &ldquo;grey old
fellow, poet Joe,&rdquo; of Swift&rsquo;s verses &ldquo;On the
little house by the Churchyard at Castlenock.&rdquo;&nbsp; Joseph
Beaumont, a linen-merchant, is described as &ldquo;a venerable,
handsome, grey-headed man, of quick and various natural
abilities, but not improved by learning.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
inventions and mathematical speculations, relating to the
longitude and other things, brought on mental troubles, which
were intensified by bankruptcy, about 1718.&nbsp; He was
afterwards removed from Dublin to his home at Trim, where he
rallied; but in a few years his madness returned, and he
committed suicide.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1c"></a><a href="#citation1c"
class="footnote">[1c]</a>&nbsp; Vicar of Trim, and formerly a
Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin.&nbsp; In various places in his
correspondence Swift criticises the failings of Dr. Anthony
Raymond, who was, says Scott, &ldquo;a particular
friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; His unreliability in money matters, the
improvidence of his large family, his peculiarities in grammar,
his pride in his good manners, all these points are noticed in
the journal and elsewhere.&nbsp; But when Dr. Raymond returned to
Ireland after a visit to London, Swift felt a little melancholy,
and regretted that he had not seen more of him.&nbsp; In July
1713 Raymond was presented to the Crown living of Moyenet.</p>

verses as &ldquo;wise and great.&rdquo;&nbsp; Afterwards he was
to call her &ldquo;an old beast&rdquo; (<i>Journal</i>, Nov. 11,
1710).&nbsp; Their quarrel arose, towards the close of 1709, out
of a difference with regard to the publication of Sir William
Temple&rsquo;s Works.&nbsp; On the appearance of vol. v. Lady
Giffard charged Swift with publishing portions of the writings
from an unfaithful copy in lieu of the originals in his
possession, and in particular with printing laudatory notices of
Godolphin and Sunderland which Temple intended to omit, and with
omitting an unfavourable remark on Sunderland which Temple
intended to print.&nbsp; Swift replied that the corrections were
all made by Temple himself.</p>

every reason to believe that this was the case.&nbsp; No Colonel
Proud appears in Dalton&rsquo;s <i>Army Lists</i>.&nbsp; A
Colonel William Frowde, apparently third son of Sir Philip
Frowde, Knight, by his third wife, Margaret, daughter of Sir John
Ashburnham, was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel in Colonel
Farrington&rsquo;s (see <span class="indexpageno"><a

In November and December 1711 Swift wrote of Philip Frowde the
elder (Colonel William Frowde&rsquo;s brother) as &ldquo;an old
fool,&rdquo; in monetary difficulties.&nbsp; It is probable that
Swift&rsquo;s Colonel Proud (? Frowde) was not Colonel William
Frowde, but his nephew, Philip Frowde, junior, who was
Addison&rsquo;s friend at Oxford, and the author of two tragedies
and various poems.&nbsp; Nothing seems known of Philip
Frowde&rsquo;s connection with the army, but he is certainly

Forster&rsquo;s <i>Swift</i>, 159; Addison&rsquo;s <i>Works</i>,

driven from France in consequence of his licentious excesses, he
came to England, after many adventures in Europe, with a

17, 1711, King said that it might have been thought that
Guiscard&rsquo;s attack would have convinced the world that
Harley was not in the French interest; but it did not have that
effect with all, for some whispered the case of Fenius Rufus and
Scevinus in the 15th book of Tacitus: &ldquo;Accensis indicibus
ad prodendum Fenium Rufum, quem eundem conscium et inquisitorem
non tolerabant.&rdquo;&nbsp; Next month Swift told King that it
was reported that the Archbishop had applied this passage in a
speech made to his clergy, and explained at some length the steps
he had taken to prevent the story being published in the
<i>Postboy</i>.&nbsp; King thanked Swift for this action,
explaining that he had been arguing on Harley&rsquo;s behalf when
someone instanced the story of Rufus.</p>

sent to the Earl of Oxford by post. When he began to open it he
saw a pistol, whereupon a gentleman present [Swift] asked for the
box, and opening it, by the window, found powder, nails, etc., so
arranged that, if opened in the ordinary way, the whole would
have been fired, and two barrels discharged different ways.&nbsp;
No doubt a box so packed was received, but whether anything
serious was intended, or whether it was a hoax, cannot be said
with any certainty.&nbsp; The Earl of Oxford is said to have met
allusions to the subject with a smile, and Swift seems to have

Pope&rsquo;s friend, William Cleland, who died in 1741, aged
sixty-seven.&nbsp; William Cleland served in Spain under Lord
Rivers, but was not a Colonel, though he seems to have been a
Major.&nbsp; Afterwards he was a Commissioner of Customs in
Scotland and a Commissioner of the Land Tax in England.&nbsp;
Colonel Cleland cannot, as Scott suggested (Swift&rsquo;s
<i>Works</i>, iii. 142, xviii. 137&ndash;39, xix. 8), have been
the son of the Colonel William Cleland, Covenanter and poet, who
died in 1689, at the age of twenty-eight.&nbsp; William Cleland
allowed his name to be appended to a letter of Pope&rsquo;s
prefixed to the <i>Dunciad</i>, and Pope afterwards described him
as &ldquo;a person of universal learning, and an enlarged
conversation; no man had a warmer heart for his friends, or a
sincerer attachment to the constitution of his
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Swift, referring to this letter, wrote to
Pope, &ldquo;Pray tell me whether your Colonel (<i>sic</i>)
Cleland be a tall Scots gentleman, walking perpetually in the
Mall, and fastening upon everybody he meets, as he has often done
upon me?&rdquo; (Pope&rsquo;s <i>Works</i>, iv. 48, vii.

Bishop of Cloyne, but then a young man of twenty-eight, came to
London in January 1713.&nbsp; He was already known by his <i>New
Theory of Vision</i> and <i>Treatise on the Principles of Human
Knowledge</i>, and he brought with him his <i>Three Dialogues
between Hylas and Philonous</i>.&nbsp; Steele was among the first
to welcome him, and he soon made the acquaintance of Addison,
Pope, and Swift.&nbsp; On March 27, Berkeley wrote to Sir John
Perceval of the breach between Swift and the Whigs: &ldquo;Dr.
Swift&rsquo;s wit is admired by both of them [Addison and
Steele], and indeed by his greatest enemies, and . . .&nbsp; I
think him one of the best-matured and agreeable men in the

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
